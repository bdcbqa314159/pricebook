"""Calibration layer types — `CalibrationResult`, `OptimiserSpec`, ...

See `DESIGN.md` §3.3 for the rationale on the shape of `CalibrationResult`.
The short version: every consumer (pricing, audit, debug, regret analysis)
needs a different slice of the calibration story; expose all the slices,
not an opaque blob.

This module sits at L0 in the empirical dependency graph (see AUDIT_PLAN.md
§1). Its only load-time pricebook dependency is `core.serialisable` (also
L0), pulled in to make the result types first-class serialisable artefacts;
that edge is acyclic — `core.serialisable` imports nothing from calibration.
The lone in-function `import pricebook` in the factory below is lazy and
does not create a runtime cycle.
