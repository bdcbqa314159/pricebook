## v0.974.0 — 2026-06-13

**Fix L2 Wave-2 audit — `Uniform` and `Exponential` constructors let NaN slip through their guards.**

In IEEE 754, all comparisons against NaN return False. So a naive guard like

```python
if a >= b:
    raise ...
```

silently accepts `a=NaN, b=NaN` (NaN >= NaN is False). The constructor succeeded, then downstream `cdf` / `pdf` propagated NaN through the user's computation with no diagnostic.

**Fix**: both constructors now explicitly check `math.isnan(...)` before the inequality guard and raise `ValueError` with a diagnostic message that names the IEEE 754 root cause.

### Verification — `test_l2_t4_distribution_nan_guards.py`

8 new tests, all pass:
- `TestUniformNaNGuards` × 4: NaN-a, NaN-b, both-NaN raise; valid (a, b) works.
- `TestExponentialNaNGuards` × 3: NaN rate raises; valid rate works; ±inf rate documented.
- `TestPreFixSlipThroughGuard`: pins down the IEEE 754 NaN-compares-False semantics.

Full parallel suite: **12350 passed in 3:12** — zero regressions.

Forty-second fix from the **35-module deferred Wave-2 audit**.

## v0.973.0 — 2026-06-13

**Fix L2 Wave-2 audit — `calibrate_svensson` had no degeneracy guard for `τ1 ≈ τ2`.**

The Svensson parameterisation has two decay constants `tau1` and `tau2`. When they collapse to (approximately) the same value, the second Svensson factor becomes a linear combination of the first plus the NS factor — so the objective surface develops a flat valley along the (beta2, beta3) ridge. Nelder-Mead can then drift arbitrarily far in that direction without the loss changing, producing wildly different parameter sets that all "calibrate" equally well to the same input.

**Fix**: penalise small `|τ1 − τ2|` in the objective (threshold 0.05) to keep the optimizer in the identifiable region of parameter space. The `τ <= 0.01` lower-bound guard is unchanged.

### Verification — `test_l2_t4_svensson_tau_degeneracy.py`

3 new tests, all pass:
- `test_calibrated_taus_well_separated` — post-calibration `|τ1−τ2| ≥ 0.05`.
- `test_svensson_fits_smooth_curve` — guard doesn't break healthy calibration; RMSE < 1%.
- `test_svensson_calibration_returns_finite_values` — all 6 parameters finite.

Pre-existing 13 NS tests still pass.

Full parallel suite: **12342 passed in 3:07** — zero regressions.

Forty-first fix from the **35-module deferred Wave-2 audit**.

---

## v0.972.0 — 2026-06-13

**Fix L2 Wave-2 audit — `Normal` and `LogNormal` accepted `sigma=0` or `sigma<0` without validation.**

Pre-fix:
- `Normal(sigma=0)`: `cdf/pdf` divided by zero, emitting `RuntimeWarning` and returning 1.0 (or NaN) silently.
- `Normal(sigma=-1)`: produced a flipped distribution (math runs, but σ < 0 is meaningless — only σ ≥ 0 parameterises a normal).
- `LogNormal(sigma=0)`: same divide-by-zero pattern as Normal.

**Fix**: both constructors now raise `ValueError("sigma must be > 0")` at construction with a clear diagnostic.

### Verification — `test_l2_t4_distribution_sigma_validation.py`

6 new tests, all pass:
- `TestNormalSigmaValidation` × 3: zero, negative, positive.
- `TestLogNormalSigmaValidation` × 3: same coverage.

Full parallel suite: **12339 passed in 3:12** — zero regressions.

Fortieth fix from the **35-module deferred Wave-2 audit**.

---

## v0.971.0 — 2026-06-13

**Fix L2 Wave-2 audit — `cos_price` crashed with opaque exceptions deep in the formula on three degenerate inputs.**

Pre-fix:
- **`L=0`**: ``b - a = 0`` (truncation half-width `L·sqrt(c2) = 0`) → `ZeroDivisionError` inside the V_k recursion's `2.0 / (b - a)` factor.
- **`spot <= 0`**: `math.log(spot / strike)` raised `math domain error` with no diagnostic about which input was bad.
- **`strike <= 0`**: `spot / strike` raised `ZeroDivisionError` (zero strike) or produced a nonsensical negative log argument.

**Fix**: validate all three upfront with `ValueError` and an explicit message identifying the offending parameter.

### Verification — `test_l2_t4_cos_price_input_validation.py`

7 new tests, all pass:
- `TestSpotValidation` × 2: zero and negative spot raise.
- `TestStrikeValidation` × 2: zero and negative strike raise.
- `TestLValidation` × 2: zero and negative L raise.
- `TestHealthyPathUnchanged`: ATM call on BS still prices correctly (~10.45).

Pre-existing 12 cos_method tests still pass.

Full parallel suite: **12333 passed in 3:02** — zero regressions.

Thirty-ninth fix from the **35-module deferred Wave-2 audit**.

## v0.970.0 — 2026-06-13

**Fix L2 Wave-2 audit — `calibrate_nelson_siegel` and `calibrate_svensson` had three contract gaps.**

Pre-fix:
1. **Empty `market_yields`** raised `IndexError` at `market_yields[-1]` inside default initial-guess construction, no diagnostic.
2. **Mismatched `len(tenors) != len(market_yields)`** was silently masked by `zip()` which truncates to the shorter — a user passing 10 tenors and 8 yields silently got a calibration on the first 8 points only.
3. **The optimizer's convergence flag was discarded** — the returned dict gave no way for the caller to detect a non-converged calibration (it could go straight into a production curve, with no signal that the fit was bad).

**Fix**:
- New helper `_validate_calibration_inputs` checks non-empty AND matching lengths upfront — raises `ValueError` with clear messages.
- Returned dict now includes `converged: bool` from the underlying optimizer result.

### Verification — `test_l2_t4_nelson_siegel_calibration_validation.py`

8 new tests, all pass:
- `TestEmptyInputsRaise` × 3: empty tenors, empty yields, Svensson empty all raise.
- `TestMismatchedLengthsRaise` × 2: NS and Svensson both raise on mismatched lengths.
- `TestConvergedFieldReported` × 2: `converged: bool` present in both NS and Svensson result dicts.
- `TestHealthyCalibrationPreserved`: smooth synthetic curve still calibrates to RMSE < 1%.

Pre-existing 13 NS/Svensson tests still pass.

Full parallel suite: **12326 passed in 3:01** — zero regressions.

Thirty-eighth fix from the **35-module deferred Wave-2 audit**.

## v0.969.0 — 2026-06-13

**Fix L2 Wave-2 audit — `FRA.pv_ctx` silently picked the "first" projection curve when the day-count-keyed lookup missed.**

Pre-fix:

```python
if dc_key and dc_key in ctx.projection_curves:
    proj = ctx.projection_curves[dc_key]
else:
    proj = next(iter(ctx.projection_curves.values()))
```

In a multi-curve setup (e.g. ACT/360 USD-LIBOR FRA priced against a context with only ACT/365 GBP projection curves), the FRA silently got a wrong-curve forward rate. The day-count mismatch could be several basis points and was completely invisible to the user.

**Fix**: keyed-lookup miss now raises `KeyError` listing the offending day-count and the available keys. The legacy fallback to the discount curve when the context has NO projection curves at all is preserved (the unambiguous single-curve case).

### Verification — `test_l2_t4_fra_pv_ctx_keyed_lookup.py`

3 new tests, all pass:
- `test_act_360_fra_no_act_360_curve_raises` — ACT/360 FRA against ACT/365-only context raises.
- `test_act_360_fra_with_matching_curve_prices` — matching day-count gives a finite PV.
- `test_empty_projection_falls_back` — empty projection-curves dict still falls back to the discount curve (single-curve compat).

Full parallel suite: **12318 passed in 2:35** — zero regressions.

Thirty-seventh fix from the **35-module deferred Wave-2 audit**.

---

## v0.968.0 — 2026-06-13

**Fix L2 Wave-2 audit — `smith_wilson_forward` silently returned `ufr` when its finite-difference DFs went non-positive.**

```python
if p1 <= 0 or p2 <= 0:
    return ufr
```

Non-positive Smith-Wilson DFs are NOT a normal regime — they indicate arbitrageable input DFs, extrapolation gone off the rails, or extreme `alpha`. Pre-fix the user got "the answer is UFR" silently, masking a calibration failure that should fail loudly.

**Fix**: raise `ValueError` with diagnostic context (the offending DF values, the `t` parameter, and likely upstream causes).

### Verification — `test_l2_t4_smith_wilson_silent_ufr.py`

2 new tests, all pass:
- `TestSilentUFRReplacedByRaise::test_non_positive_dfs_raise` — synthesise a wild-zeta state, scan for a `t` where DFs go negative, confirm the function raises.
- `TestHealthyForwardWorks::test_normal_calibration_forward_finite` — normal calibrated state still returns a finite forward in the expected market-rate range.

Pre-existing 10 Smith-Wilson tests still pass.

Full parallel suite: **12315 passed in 3:01** — zero regressions.

Thirty-sixth fix from the **35-module deferred Wave-2 audit**.

---

## v0.967.0 — 2026-06-13

**Fix L2 Wave-2 audit — `MCEngine(n_paths=1)` silently produced NaN stderr instead of failing fast.**

Pre-fix:
- `MCEngine(..., n_paths=1, antithetic=True)`: `n_half = 1 // 2 = 0` → ZERO paths generated. `np.std(..., ddof=1)` of zero samples is NaN — silent.
- `MCEngine(..., n_paths=1, antithetic=False)`: single-path "MC" with `np.std(..., ddof=1)` of one sample is also NaN.

Both modes are useless for Monte Carlo (you need at least 2 samples to estimate variance), but pre-fix the engine ran them silently and reported NaN downstream into `MCResult.stderr` and `confidence_95`.

**Fix**:
- `n_paths < 2` → `ValueError` upfront.
- `antithetic=True` AND `n_paths < 4` → `ValueError` (the engine uses `n_half = n_paths // 2` antithetic pairs; 2 paths give only 1 pair, which is also degenerate for ddof=1 stderr).

### Verification — `test_l2_t4_mcengine_n_paths_validation.py`

7 new tests, all pass:
- `TestNPathsValidation` × 3: `n_paths` of 1, 0, or negative raises.
- `TestAntitheticMinimum` × 3: antithetic with 2 or 3 paths raises; 4 paths works.
- `TestHealthyPathUnchanged`: large `n_paths` (1000) works.

Full parallel suite: **12313 passed in 3:02** — zero regressions.

Thirty-fifth fix from the **35-module deferred Wave-2 audit**.

---

## v0.966.0 — 2026-06-13

**Fix L2 Wave-2 audit — `mc_engine.TimeGrid` accepted any array, even empty or non-monotonic, silently producing nonsense state.**

Pre-fix the constructor was:

```python
def __init__(self, times):
    self.times = np.asarray(times, dtype=np.float64)
    self.dt = np.diff(self.times)
    self.n_steps = len(self.dt)
    self.T = float(self.times[-1])       # IndexError on empty
```

Three silent failure modes:
1. **Empty input** → `self.times[-1]` raises `IndexError` deep inside the constructor with no diagnostic message.
2. **Length-1 input** → `dt = []`, `n_steps = 0`, T set to the one time point. The engine loops zero times — silent no-op.
3. **Non-monotonic input** → `dt` has negative entries. The engine integrates the SDE BACKWARDS in time for those steps, with wrong-sign drift. Pre-fix this was silent; the user got a finite "price" computed against time-reversed dynamics.

**Fix**: validate at construction — empty/singleton/non-monotonic input all raise `ValueError` with a clear diagnostic.

### Verification — `test_l2_t4_timegrid_validation.py`

6 new tests, all pass:
- `test_empty_array_raises`, `test_singleton_raises` — size-validation.
- `test_decreasing_raises`, `test_duplicate_raises` — monotonicity-validation.
- `test_uniform_works`, `test_explicit_increasing_works` — happy paths preserved.

Full parallel suite: **12306 passed in 3:03** — zero regressions.

Thirty-fourth fix from the **35-module deferred Wave-2 audit**.

## v0.965.0 — 2026-06-13

**Fix L2 Wave-2 audit — `bachelier_delta` at exactly ATM (`F == K`) with `T<=0 or vol<=0` returned 0 instead of the standard `±0.5·df` one-sided limit.**

Pre-fix:

```python
if time_to_expiry <= 0 or vol_normal <= 0:
    if option_type == OptionType.CALL:
        return df if forward > strike else 0.0
    return -df if forward < strike else 0.0
```

The `else 0.0` branch caught both `F < K` (correct for a call OTM) AND `F == K` (incorrect — ATM-at-expiry should be `0.5·df`). Symmetric bug for puts.

**Fix**: explicit ATM branch returns `±0.5·df` matching the same convention used (correctly) by `black76_delta`.

### Verification — `test_l2_t4_bachelier_delta_atm.py`

8 new tests, all pass:
- `TestBachelierDeltaATMAtExpiry` × 3: ATM call/put at T=0 give `±0.5·df`; ATM with vol=0 (T>0) also gives `±0.5·df`.
- `TestConsistencyWithBlack76Delta` × 2: `bachelier_delta` and `black76_delta` agree on the ATM-at-expiry limit.
- `TestNonATMUnaffected` × 3: ITM call returns `df`; OTM call returns 0; ITM put returns `-df` — pre-fix behaviour preserved off-ATM.

Full parallel suite: **12300 passed in 2:35** — zero regressions.

Thirty-third fix from the **35-module deferred Wave-2 audit**.

---

## v0.964.0 — 2026-06-13

**Fix L2 Wave-2 audit — `integrate_semi_infinite` silently downgraded any non-Laguerre method to ADAPTIVE.**

Pre-fix:

```python
if method == IntegrationMethod.GAUSS_LAGUERRE:
    ... Gauss-Laguerre code ...
else:
    return _adaptive(f, a, np.inf)      # discards user's `method`
```

A user passing `method=IntegrationMethod.GAUSS_HERMITE` or `method=IntegrationMethod.SIMPSON` got the SciPy adaptive result with no warning that their METHOD argument was discarded. A method-comparison study would see identical numbers for every "method" choice — silently masking the fact that only one method was actually running.

**Fix**: only the two methods with defined semi-infinite behaviour (`GAUSS_LAGUERRE`, `ADAPTIVE`) are accepted; everything else raises `ValueError` with a pointer to the documented choices and an explicit note that this used to be a silent downgrade.

### Verification — `test_l2_t4_integrate_semi_infinite_method.py`

9 new tests, all pass:
- `TestSupportedMethodsWork` × 2: GAUSS_LAGUERRE and ADAPTIVE both correctly compute `∫_0^∞ e^{-x} dx = 1`.
- `TestUnsupportedMethodsRaise` × 7: every other `IntegrationMethod` value (LEGENDRE/HERMITE/SIMPSON/TRAPEZOID/TANH_SINH/CLENSHAW_CURTIS/ROMBERG) raises.

Full parallel suite: **12292 passed in 3:04** — zero regressions.

Thirty-second fix from the **35-module deferred Wave-2 audit**.

---

## v0.963.0 — 2026-06-13

**Fix L2 Wave-2 audit — `_simpson` and `_trapezoid` crashed with `ZeroDivisionError` on `n=0`.**

Both routines compute `h = (b - a) / n` directly with no validation. A caller routing through the public `integrate(method=…, n=0)` API got an opaque `ZeroDivisionError` deep in the implementation with no diagnostic context.

**Fix**: both routines raise `ValueError` upfront with a clear message ("n must be >= 1") if `n < 1`.

### Verification — `test_l2_t4_integrate_simpson_trap_zero_n.py`

6 new tests, all pass:
- Each of `_simpson` and `_trapezoid`: `n=0` raises, `n<0` raises, `n>=1` produces correct integral (ATM `∫x² dx` ≈ 1/3 for Simpson; ATM `∫x dx` = 0.5 for trapezoid).

Full parallel suite: **12283 passed in 3:03** — zero regressions.

Thirty-first fix from the **35-module deferred Wave-2 audit**.

---

## v0.962.0 — 2026-06-13

**Fix L2 Wave-2 audit — `minimize(method=…)` rejected the natural hyphenated method-string form.**

Pre-fix the string-to-enum dispatch was `OptimMethod(method.lower())` — so passing the form scipy itself uses (`"Nelder-Mead"`, `"L-BFGS-B"`) raised:

> `ValueError: 'nelder-mead' is not a valid OptimMethod`

The enum values use underscores (`"nelder_mead"`). This is an ergonomic trap: users copy-paste a method name from scipy docs and get a hard error with no hint that the fix is to swap `-` for `_`.

**Fix**: normalise hyphens to underscores in addition to lower-casing — `method.lower().replace("-", "_")`. Hyphenated, underscored, and `OptimMethod` enum forms all work now.

### Verification — `test_l2_t4_minimize_method_string_normalisation.py`

6 new tests, all pass:
- `test_Nelder_Mead_with_hyphen`, `test_L_BFGS_B_with_hyphens` — scipy-style forms.
- `test_nelder_mead_underscore`, `test_l_bfgs_b_underscore` — underscore forms still work.
- `test_enum_method` — direct enum still works.
- `test_unknown_method_string_raises` — sanity: unknown strings still raise.

Full parallel suite: **12277 passed in 2:34** — zero regressions.

Thirtieth fix from the **35-module deferred Wave-2 audit**.

---

## v0.961.0 — 2026-06-13

**Fix L2 Wave-2 audit — `projection_l1_ball` returned the INPUT alias when `x` was already inside the L1 ball.**

```python
if np.sum(np.abs(x)) <= radius:
    return x         # ← aliasing bug
```

Mutating the result then mutated the caller's input array. The other branch (`np.sign(x) * proj`) always returned a fresh array via broadcast multiplication, so the inconsistency was: fast path aliased, slow path did not. A defensive consumer expecting consistent ownership got a shared buffer in the fast path.

**Fix**: both branches now return a fresh array (`x.copy()` in the fast path, broadcast multiplication in the slow path).

### Verification — `test_l2_t4_projection_l1_ball_aliasing.py`

5 new tests, all pass:
- `test_result_is_fresh_copy_when_inside_ball` — fast-path returns a fresh object.
- `test_mutating_result_does_not_mutate_input` — most important: writes to result do not propagate to input.
- `test_result_is_not_input_when_outside_ball` — slow path still copies.
- `test_projected_value_norm_equals_radius` — projection math correct.
- `test_projection_inside_ball_is_identity` — value is unchanged when input is already feasible.

Full parallel suite: **12271 passed in 2:33** — zero regressions.

Twenty-ninth fix from the **35-module deferred Wave-2 audit**.

## v0.960.0 — 2026-06-13

**Fix L2 Wave-2 audit — `minimize(method=BASIN_HOPPING)` hardcoded `converged=True`.**

```python
return OptimizeResult(r.x, float(r.fun), r.nit, True, "basin_hopping")
                                                  ^^^^
```

The basin-hopping wrapper produced a guaranteed-true convergence flag regardless of outcome. A calibration loop relying on `result.converged` would proceed downstream even when the inner local optimizer hit `maxiter` without succeeding.

**Fix**: scipy's `basinhopping` doesn't expose a top-level success flag, but its `lowest_optimization_result` (the best local-optimization result) carries a `.success` attribute. Use that as the honest signal — if even the best local solve didn't succeed, the global search ended unconvinced too.

### Verification — `test_l2_t4_basin_hopping_converged.py`

2 new tests, all pass:
- `test_smooth_quadratic_converges` — basin-hopping on a smooth quadratic finds the global minimum and reports `converged=True` (the inner L-BFGS local solve succeeds).
- `test_returns_proper_result_object` — sanity: `OptimizeResult` shape preserved.

Full parallel suite: **12266 passed in 2:32** — zero regressions.

Twenty-eighth fix from the **35-module deferred Wave-2 audit**.

## v0.959.0 — 2026-06-13

**Fix L2 Wave-2 audit — `proximal_gradient` lied about its result in two ways.**

Pre-fix:

1. **`OptimizeResult.fun` was unconditionally `0.0`.** A calibration consumer reading `result.fun` saw "zero" and concluded the solver had found the optimum, when in fact the solver had no idea what the objective value was (the function never receives `f` — only `grad_f`).

2. **`OptimizeResult.converged` was unconditionally `True`.** The loop could exhaust `maxiter` without the tolerance check ever firing, and the caller had no way to know — `result.converged` was a rubber stamp.

**Fix**:
- Added optional `f_obj` parameter: if supplied, `fun` is the true objective at the final iterate.
- If `f_obj` is omitted, `fun = float('nan')` — a clear sentinel that the value is unknown (NOT zero).
- `converged` now reflects whether the tolerance check actually fired during iteration.
- Loop counter `k` is initialised before the loop so the `iterations` count is well-defined even for `maxiter=0`.

### Verification — `test_l2_t4_proximal_gradient_reporting.py`

5 new tests, all pass:
- `test_converged_true_when_tolerance_fires` — generous params → converged=True.
- `test_converged_false_when_maxiter_exhausted` — tiny step + tight tol + low maxiter → converged=False.
- `test_fun_is_nan_when_no_objective_supplied` — clear sentinel for unknown.
- `test_fun_is_correct_when_objective_supplied` — `f_obj=…` gives true `fun` value (≈ 0 at minimum of `0.5||x − x*||²`).
- `test_recovers_smooth_quad_optimum` — sanity check that the solver still finds the optimum.

Full parallel suite: **12264 passed in 2:32** — zero regressions.

Twenty-seventh fix from the **35-module deferred Wave-2 audit**.

## v0.958.0 — 2026-06-13

**Fix L2 Wave-2 audit — `antithetic_paths` had a bimodal interface that was misleading in one branch and mathematically WRONG in the other.**

Pre-fix two-branch behaviour:

1. **Called with `rng_normals=Z`**: returned `-Z` (just negated the argument). The function's name suggested it returned PATHS, not negated normals — the caller had to know to rebuild paths from `-Z` themselves. Misleading.

2. **Called WITHOUT `rng_normals`**: computed "mirror around log-mean of terminal values": `antithetic = exp(2·log_mean - log(terminal))`. This is NOT a valid antithetic — the transformation depends on the SAMPLE mean (a random quantity), so the result is biased and not properly antithetic. It also ran `np.log` on terminal spots, silently producing `NaN` for Bachelier/OU/etc. paths where terminal spots can be ≤ 0.

**Fix**:
- Renamed the function to `antithetic_normals` to reflect what it actually does (returns `-Z`).
- Requires the normal draws explicitly (positional, no default).
- Only performs the valid `-Z` operation; the broken "mirror" branch is gone.
- Legacy alias `antithetic_paths = antithetic_normals` kept so existing imports don't break.
- Both names exported from `pricebook.numerical.__init__`.

### Verification — `test_l2_t4_antithetic_normals_api.py`

5 new tests, all pass:
- `test_returns_negated_array` — 1-D and 2-D arrays correctly negated.
- `test_array_2d_works` — large 2-D draws negated element-wise.
- `test_estimator_unbiased_and_variance_reduced` — antithetic estimator of `E[exp(Z)]` has strictly lower sample variance than two independent runs (the canonical variance-reduction proof).
- `test_antithetic_paths_alias` — legacy alias points to the same function.
- `test_alias_returns_negated_normals` — alias also works.

Full parallel suite: **12259 passed in 2:32** — zero regressions.

## v0.957.0 — 2026-06-13

**Fix L2 Wave-2 audit — `CharacteristicFunction.density` two robustness gaps.**

1. **`density(x_grid, n_quad=1)`** raised `IndexError` at `du = u[1] - u[0]` because the `linspace` had only one point. Now raises `ValueError` upfront with a clear message ("n_quad must be >= 2").

2. **`density(scalar)`** (a single x point as a Python float or 0-d ndarray) raised `TypeError` at `len(x)` because `np.asarray(scalar)` produces a 0-d array which has no `len()`. Now scalar inputs are promoted to a 1-element array via `np.atleast_1d`.

### Verification — `test_l2_t4_characteristic_function_density.py`

5 new tests, all pass:
- `TestDensityValidation` × 2: `n_quad=1` and `n_quad=0` raise.
- `TestDensityScalarInput` × 2: scalar and Python float both accepted; returned shape is `(1,)` and the N(0,1) density at 0 is recovered to ≈ 1/√(2π).
- `TestDensityHealthyPath`: closed-form N(0,1) recovery test for `[-1, 0, 1]`.

Full parallel suite: **12254 passed in 2:56** — zero regressions.

Twenty-fifth fix from the **35-module deferred Wave-2 audit**.

## v0.956.0 — 2026-06-13

**Fix L2 Wave-2 audit — `models/feynman_kac.py` had three silent contract violations.**

1. **`sde_to_pde(rate_fn=None)`** silently defaulted to a 4% constant rate. A user calling the helper without specifying the rate would get a PDE parameterised at 4%; if they then ran an MC at a different rate, the cross-comparison would be biased by exactly the rate disagreement, with no warning. Now raises `ValueError`.

2. **`pde_to_sde`** used `math.sqrt(max(2·diffusion, 0))` — silently clamping NEGATIVE PDE diffusion (which is unphysical: the PDE diffusion coefficient `a = ½σ²` is non-negative by construction) to zero. Bugs in upstream coefficient functions producing negative `a` would be masked. Now raises `ValueError` on negative diffusion at the evaluation point.

3. **`verify_feynman_kac(n_time=...)`** ignored the user-supplied `n_time` for the MC time grid (hardcoded to 100), so a user thinking they were refining BOTH MC and PDE in lockstep to study convergence was actually only refining the PDE. The docstring promises "Both use the same model" — broken in the wiring. Now the MC grid uses `n_time` steps.

### Verification — `test_l2_t4_feynman_kac_contracts.py`

7 new tests, all pass:
- `TestSdeToPdeRequiresRate` × 3: `rate_fn=None` raises; scalar still works; callable still works.
- `TestPdeToSdeRejectsNegativeDiffusion` × 3: negative raises; zero returns zero vol; positive unchanged.
- `TestVerifyFeynmanKacUsesNTime`: smoke test confirming `n_time=50` vs `n_time=200` both run without error.

Pre-existing 3 Feynman-Kac tests still pass.

## v0.955.0 — 2026-06-13

**Fix L2 Wave-2 audit — `Dual` math operations silently produced wrong derivatives at known singularities.**

Five degenerate paths in `numerical.auto_diff`:

1. **`sqrt(Dual(0, x))`** returned `Dual(0, 0)`. Mathematically the derivative `1/(2·√x) → +∞` at `x = 0`. Silent zero hides failures in MC paths that touch zero (e.g. Heston QE-discretisation variance at the zero-boundary).

2. **`Dual(0, x) ** Dual(y, z)`** returned `Dual(0, 0)` regardless of exponent — derivative `val · (z·log(0) + y·der/0)` has a `log(0)` singularity that the pre-fix code hid behind an `if self.val != 0 else 0` shortcut.

3. **`Dual(negative, x) ** Dual(y, z)`** computed `math.log(abs(self.val))` — `log` of a negative number is not real, but the `abs()` made the formula run and produced a meaningless float.

4. **`Dual(0, x) ** n`** with `n < 1` was a singularity disguised as `n · 0^(n-1) · der` (Python raises `ZeroDivisionError` for `n<1`, or silently gives 0 for fractional `n`).

5. **`b ** Dual(x, y)`** with `b ≤ 0` returned `der = 0` silently — `log(b)` is undefined there.

All five paths now raise `ValueError` with diagnostic context (which input is singular and why). The integer-exponent case for negative base is preserved (e.g. `(-2)^3` has real value and well-defined real derivative). The healthy positive-base path is unchanged.

### Verification — `test_l2_t4_auto_diff_singularities.py`

14 new tests, all pass:
- `TestSqrtAtZeroRaises` × 3: zero-base raises; positive-base correct derivative; plain float unaffected.
- `TestPowAtZeroBaseRaises` × 4: Dual exp / fractional / negative exp raise; integer n≥1 works (n=1 gives der=1, n=2 gives der=0).
- `TestPowAtNegativeBaseRaises` × 2: Dual exp raises; integer exp works for negative base.
- `TestRpowAtNonPositiveBaseRaises` × 3: zero/negative base raise; positive base correct (`2^Dual(3,1)` gives 8·ln(2)).
- `TestHealthyPathsUnchanged` × 2: basic power/sqrt with positive Dual base produce correct (val, der).

Pre-existing tests still pass.

## v0.954.0 — 2026-06-13

**Fix L2 Wave-2 audit — `Dual` defined `__eq__` without `__hash__`, breaking hashability and violating the Python hash/eq contract.**

Defining `__eq__` automatically sets `__hash__ = None`, making the class unhashable. Pre-fix any attempt to put a `Dual` in a dict or set raised `TypeError: unhashable type: 'Dual'` — surprising for a number-like object.

Even if hashability had been preserved by inheritance, the Python data-model contract `a == b ⇒ hash(a) == hash(b)` would require careful choice: `Dual.__eq__` compares ONLY `val` (`Dual(1, 2) == 1.0` is True — a deliberate design for float compatibility), so the hash must depend only on `val` too.

**Fix**: define `__hash__(self) = hash(self.val)`. Dual is now usable as a dict key or set member. Distinct vals hash distinct (modulo standard float-hash collisions); Duals that compare equal — including a Dual and a plain float — hash equal.

### Verification — `test_l2_t4_dual_hash_eq_contract.py`

6 new tests, all pass:
- `test_hash_returns_int`, `test_can_be_dict_key`, `test_can_be_in_set` — hashability restored.
- `test_equal_duals_with_different_der_have_same_hash` — `Dual(1, 2)` and `Dual(1, 99)` hash equal (consistent with `__eq__`).
- `test_dual_and_equal_float_have_same_hash` — `hash(Dual(1.0, x)) == hash(1.0)`.
- `test_distinct_vals_distinct_hashes` — sanity.

Pre-existing tests still pass.

## v0.953.0 — 2026-06-13

**Fix L2 Wave-2 audit — `numerical.auto_diff` drivers (`grad`, `jacobian_ad`, `derivative`) silently returned zero gradient when the user's function failed to thread `Dual` numbers through.**

This is the **most common bug** in forward-mode AD code, and the pre-fix drivers actively hid it:

```python
# pre-fix grad
g[i] = result.der if isinstance(result, Dual) else 0.0
```

If `f` accidentally strips the `Dual` wrapper anywhere — e.g. by calling a NumPy ufunc on a list of `Duals` (which returns an ndarray of objects whose `.der` propagation doesn't work) or by routing through `math.` functions that don't recognise the wrapper — every call returns `0.0` and `grad` returns the zero vector with no warning. A user computing "delta" of a pricer with a typo or stale code path would see `grad = [0, 0, …]`, conclude the option has no Greek, and act on it.

Same shape in `jacobian_ad` (component-wise) and `derivative`.

**Fix**: all three drivers now raise `TypeError` with a diagnostic message that names the actual returned type and points at the most likely cause (NumPy ufuncs vs `math.` calls). The message also gestures at the canonical remedy (Dual-aware operations in `auto_diff`).

### Verification — `test_l2_t4_auto_diff_threading_raises.py`

7 new tests, all pass:
- `TestGradRaisesOnThreadingFailure` × 2: raises on plain-float return; correct gradient when threading works (sanity).
- `TestJacobianAdRaisesOnThreadingFailure` × 3: raises on full failure, raises on PARTIAL failure (one component is a Dual, another isn't — the trickiest case), correct Jacobian when threading works.
- `TestDerivativeRaisesOnThreadingFailure` × 2: raises on plain-float return; correct derivative when threading works.

Pre-existing tests still pass.

## v0.952.0 — 2026-06-13

**Fix L2 Wave-2 audit — `PDESolver1D` had four robustness gaps on degenerate inputs.**

Pre-fix:
1. **`n_time = 0`**: raised `ZeroDivisionError` deep inside `solve()` at `dt = T / self.n_time`, with no diagnostic context.
2. **`n_space = 0` (or 1)**: raised an opaque `IndexError` inside grid construction.
3. **`T = 0`**: produced a finite-but-WRONG price (~2.05 for an ATM call where the correct intrinsic is 0). The solver iterated `n_time` times with `dt = 0`, but the boundary projection and operator construction don't commute cleanly with zero time evolution — the result was determined by interpolation noise on the terminal payoff.
4. **`T < 0`**: produced a numerical runaway (~1e107) with no exception. Unphysical input that should fail loudly.

**Fix**:
- Constructor: `n_space < 2` or `n_time < 1` → `ValueError` with clear message.
- `solve()`: `T < 0` → `ValueError`. `T == 0` returns the intrinsic value (`max(spot−strike, 0)` for call, `max(strike−spot, 0)` for put) directly without invoking the solver — the unique no-arbitrage payoff with no time to evolve. The returned `PDEResult` carries a small valid 2-point grid so consumers reading `r.values` / `r.grid` see well-formed arrays.
- All four healthy-path branches (positive `T`, positive `n_time`/`n_space`) are unchanged.

### Verification — `test_l2_t4_pde_input_validation.py`

11 new tests, all pass:
- `TestConstructorValidation` × 4: `n_time=0`, `n_time=-1`, `n_space=0`, `n_space=1` all raise `ValueError`.
- `TestSolveValidation::test_negative_T_raises`.
- `TestZeroExpiryIntrinsic` × 5: `T=0` returns intrinsic for ITM/OTM call & put, and the result object is well-formed (`values`, `grid`, `method` present).
- `TestHealthyPathUnchanged::test_normal_solve_unchanged` — `T > 0` ATM call still prices ≈ Black-Scholes.

## v0.951.0 — 2026-06-13

**Fix L2 Wave-2 audit — `TreeSolver._compute_vega` left `_computing_vega = True` and `store_tree = False` if the inner bumped-vol `solve()` raised.**

Same exception-safety shape as the MCEngine.greek bug fixed in v0.946.

Pre-fix:

```python
self._computing_vega = True
saved_store = self.store_tree
self.store_tree = False
r_up = self.solve(...)             # if this raises, both stay set
self.store_tree = saved_store
self._computing_vega = False
```

If the bumped-vol `solve()` call raised (e.g. user-supplied `payoff_fn` that fails for stressed inputs, vol-bump pushing into a numerically degenerate regime), the solver was left with `_computing_vega = True` and `store_tree = False`. A subsequent unrelated `solve()` call would then silently produce results WITHOUT snapshots (no greeks recorded) and WITHOUT recursing into vega computation (the `not self._computing_vega` guard at line 384 / 453 would block it). The price still returned, but greeks were missing.

**Fix**: wrap the bump sequence in `try ... finally:` so both attributes are restored regardless of whether the inner solve fails. Also save the prior `_computing_vega` rather than hardcoding `False` to the restore — preserves nested-call invariants.

### Verification — `test_l2_t4_tree_vega_exception_safety.py`

3 new tests, all pass:
- `test_state_restored_when_solve_raises` — `_computing_vega` and `store_tree` restored after raise.
- `test_vega_finite_and_state_restored` — happy-path sanity.
- `test_solve_after_failed_vega_unchanged` — a `solve()` after a failed vega gives identical price to `solve()` before.

## v0.950.0 — 2026-06-13

**Fix L2 Wave-2 audit — `TreeSolver.convergence_analysis` applied Richardson extrapolation universally; theoretically wrong for CRR/JR/Tian/Trinomial (which are oscillatory O(1/N), not smooth O(1/N²)).**

The Richardson formula `P* = (4·P(2N) − P(N)) / 3` is derived from a Taylor expansion assuming the error has leading-order term `c/N²`. The "4 − 1" weighting then cancels that term, leaving O(1/N⁴). This is correct for Leisen-Reimer (smooth O(1/N²)) but FALSE for CRR/JR/Tian/Trinomial — those have **oscillatory O(1/N)** convergence (a parity sawtooth between odd and even N). Applying Richardson there over-amplifies the sawtooth rather than cancelling it.

The pre-fix routine also:
- Did NOT validate that `n_steps_list[-1] == 2 · n_steps_list[-2]`. Without doubling, the "4·P(2N) − P(N)" weighting has no theoretical basis at all.
- Did not validate that `n_steps_list` had at least 2 elements (silently returned `richardson=None`).

**Fix**:
- Validate `n_steps_list` is non-empty (≥ 2) and strictly increasing.
- Pick the extrapolation per method:
  - **LR + doubling**: Richardson formula (genuinely O(1/N²) → O(1/N⁴)).
  - **LR + non-doubling**: fall back to last price (formula invalid).
  - **CRR / JR / Tian / Trinomial**: average of the last two prices (cancels the parity sawtooth).
- Legacy `richardson` key preserved as the literal Richardson formula for backwards compatibility.
- New `extrapolated` and `extrapolation_method` keys expose the method-aware choice and a string tag identifying which scheme was used.
- Run the inner sweep in a `try ... finally:` so `n_steps` is always restored.

### Verification — `test_l2_t4_tree_convergence_method_aware.py`

7 new tests, all pass:
- `test_empty_n_steps_list_raises`, `test_non_monotonic_raises` — input validation.
- `test_lr_uses_richardson_when_doubling` — LR + doubling → Richardson.
- `test_lr_falls_back_when_non_doubling` — LR + non-doubling → last price.
- `test_crr_uses_average_not_richardson` — CRR → average; expected = mean of last two prices.
- `test_jr_uses_average` — JR same.
- `test_result_contains_both_legacy_and_new_keys` — `richardson` (legacy formula) and `extrapolated` (method-aware) both present.

Pre-existing 20 tree-solver tests still pass — backwards compatibility on the `richardson` key preserved.

## v0.949.0 — 2026-06-13

**Fix L2 Wave-2 audit — `InterestRateSwap.cashflow_schedule` floating row was internally inconsistent (`rate` excluded spread but `amount` included it).**

The pre-fix floating row reported `rate = forward` (no spread) but `amount = (forward + spread) · year_frac · notional`. A downstream consumer naturally verifying `amount = rate · year_frac · notional` got the wrong number by exactly `spread · year_frac · notional`. On a 1 mm notional swap with 50 bp spread on a quarterly period, that's ~$1,236 of "missing" amount per coupon — easy to misread in P&L attribution, cashflow reconciliation, or regulatory reporting.

**Fix**: add two new fields per row, `spread` (0 for fixed) and `notional` (period notional, correct for amortising / accreting), so the schema is fully self-describing and the invariant

> (rate + spread) · year_frac · notional == amount

holds exactly for both legs. The pre-existing `rate` / `amount` semantics are unchanged — additive change, no breakage of consumers reading legacy fields.

### Verification — `test_l2_t4_swap_cashflow_schedule_consistency.py`

6 new tests, all pass:
- `test_row_is_self_consistent_with_spread` — invariant holds to 1e-9 for every row.
- `test_floating_row_carries_explicit_spread` — new field present on float leg.
- `test_fixed_row_has_zero_spread` — uniform schema.
- `test_notional_field_present_on_both_legs` — bullet swap.
- `test_amortising_notional_in_row` — amortising-leg notional decreases period by period.
- `test_all_legacy_fields_still_present` — backwards-compatibility.

## v0.948.0 — 2026-06-13

**Fix L2 Wave-2 audit — `equity_delta` degenerate-input branch had three coupled bugs.**

In the `T <= 0 or vol <= 0` branch of `options/equity_option.py::equity_delta`:

1. **Wrong moneyness test**: compared `spot` to `strike` instead of `forward` to `strike`. For a non-zero dividend yield, `forward = spot · exp((r-q)·T)` can differ materially from spot. Concrete failure: `spot=100, strike=99, q=0.10, T=1` → forward ≈ 90.48 < 99. A call is **OTM on forward** (true zero-vol delta = 0) but the pre-fix code, comparing spot > strike, returned **1.0**. Conversely, the matching put is ITM on forward but pre-fix returned 0.

2. **Unit magnitude instead of `exp(-q·T)`**: ITM ITM branch returned literal `1.0` (call) / `-1.0` (put) instead of `±exp(-q·T)`. Spot delta of an ITM call replicates as `∂(S - K·exp(-rT))/∂S = exp(-q·T)`, NOT `1`. Inconsistent with `black76_delta` which correctly returns `±df`.

3. **ATM hole**: at exact ATM (forward == strike) the pre-fix returned 0 for both call and put, instead of the standard `±0.5·exp(-q·T)` limit — asymmetric vs `black76_delta` which handles this explicitly.

**Fix**: all three branches now compare forward to strike, scale by `exp(-q·T)`, and return `±0.5·exp(-q·T)` at exact ATM — exactly the chain-rule lift of `black76_delta` from forward delta to spot delta.

### Verification — `test_l2_t4_equity_delta_degenerate.py`

7 new tests, all pass:
- `test_call_itm_on_spot_but_otm_on_forward_returns_zero` — q=10% case: delta is 0, not 1.

- `test_atm_call_returns_half_exp_minus_qT`, `test_atm_put_returns_minus_half_exp_minus_qT` — ATM limit.
- `test_interior_delta_unchanged` — sanity check: `T>0, vol>0` path is identical to pre-fix.

## v0.947.0 — 2026-06-13

**Fix L2 Wave-2 audit — `price_swaption_sabr_hw` had two silent-failure paths: `blend_half_life=0` divided by zero deep in the pricer, and a hard-coded 1% volatility fallback when both SABR and HW vols failed.**

Two real bugs in the SABR-HW blender, distinct from the T=0 intrinsic bug already closed under T2.15:

1. **`blend_half_life` was not validated.** Passing `0` (or negative) caused `math.exp(-T / 0.0)` to raise `ZeroDivisionError` deep inside the pricer with no diagnostic context — the user saw a stack trace blaming `math` rather than the actual bad input.

2. **Silent 1% vol fallback.** When BOTH SABR and HW vols returned non-positive values (e.g. failed cube lookup + degenerate HW calibration), the code substituted `blended_vol = 0.01` (1%) — an arbitrary value that nonetheless produced a finite Black-76 "price" with no warning. Downstream calibration or risk could read this as a real number.

**Fix**:
- `blend_half_life <= 0` now raises `ValueError` with a clear message at the start of the function.
- When both SABR and HW vols are non-positive, raise `ValueError` instead of falling back to 1%. The caller can then diagnose the upstream calibration failure rather than carrying a wrong price forward.

### Verification — `test_l2_t4_sabr_hw_blender_guards.py`

4 new tests, all pass:
- `test_zero_blend_half_life_raises_value_error` — guard fires.
- `test_negative_blend_half_life_raises_value_error` — guard fires.

## v0.946.0 — 2026-06-13

**Fix L2 Wave-2 audit — `MCEngine.greek` left `process.x0` (or a bumped attribute) in the bumped state when `price()` raised inside the up/down evaluation.**

Pre-fix structure:

```python
self.process.x0[i] = original + bump
price_up = self.price(...)          # if this raises, x0 stays bumped
self.process.x0[i] = original - bump
price_dn = self.price(...)
self.process.x0 = original_x0       # only runs on happy path
```

If `self.price(...)` raised an exception during the up-bump or down-bump (e.g. a payoff that fails for stressed inputs, a numerical issue in the underlying simulation, or a user-level `KeyboardInterrupt`), the caller's `ProcessSpec.x0` was left in the bumped state. A subsequent unrelated `price()` call on the same engine then silently used a corrupted state with no warning.

Same shape for the attribute branch.

**Fix**: wrap each bump sequence in `try ... finally:` so the original state is restored even when up/down prices fail.

### Verification — `test_l2_t4_mc_engine_greek_exception_safety.py`

4 new tests, all pass:
- `test_x0_restored_when_price_raises` — `process.x0` restored after payoff raises.
- `test_attribute_restored_when_price_raises` — same for the attribute branch.
- `test_subsequent_price_unaffected_after_greek_raises` — most important: a `price()` call AFTER a failed `greek()` matches the reference price to 1e-9.
- `test_greek_returns_finite_and_restores` — happy-path sanity check.

While auditing the same module I also verified the **Cholesky einsum** that the critic flagged (`'...j,kj->...k'`) is actually CORRECT — it computes `L · Z` (not `L^T · Z`), which has covariance `L · L^T = Σ` as desired. Empirically verified against a 3×3 correlation matrix to 0.15%.

## v0.945.0 — 2026-06-13

**Fix L2 Wave-2 audit — `InterestRateSwap.accreting` silently dropped `final_notional` for single-period schedules; `amortising` docstring clarified.**

`accreting` constructed per-period notionals via

> initial + (final − initial) · i / max(n − 1, 1)

For **n = 1** the divisor was `max(0, 1) = 1` and the loop ran only `i = 0`, yielding `initial + 0 · … = initial` — `final_notional` was completely ignored. A user calling

> `accreting(initial=500_000, final=1_000_000)`

on a single-period schedule (e.g. 6-month semi-annual swap) silently got `[500_000]` with no accretion and no warning.

**Fix**: for n = 1, return the average `(initial + final) / 2` — the unique value that honours BOTH endpoint inputs and is symmetric in `initial`/`final`. Multi-period behaviour is unchanged. Also tidied the multi-period formula: divisor is now `(n − 1)` directly inside the n ≥ 2 branch (no spurious `max(…)`).

Also clarified the `amortising` docstring: the original "decreases linearly to zero" was ambiguous and led the audit critic to claim a bug. The implementation is correct under standard market convention (period i has outstanding notional `initial · (1 − i/n)`; the final period carries `initial/n`; the post-maturity state is zero). The docstring now states this explicitly.

### Verification — `test_l2_t4_swap_accreting_single_period.py`

5 new tests, all pass:
- `test_single_period_uses_average_of_endpoints` — n=1 returns `[750_000]` for inputs `(500K, 1M)`.
- `test_single_period_with_equal_endpoints` — n=1 with identical endpoints is unchanged.
- `test_final_notional_is_honoured` — explicit assertion that the pre-fix bug is gone (post-fix ≠ 500K).
- `test_endpoints_match_inputs` — multi-period: first = initial, last = final, linear in between.

## v0.944.0 — 2026-06-12

**Fix L2 Wave-2 audit — `FixedRateBond.dirty_price` included upcoming coupon during the ex-dividend window, double-counting against negative accrued.**

Bond market convention: between the record date (ex-div date) and the next coupon payment date, the upcoming coupon goes to the seller — the buyer does NOT receive it. `accrued_interest` correctly returns a NEGATIVE value in this window to compensate. But `dirty_price` summed every cashflow with `payment_date > settlement`, INCLUDING the unreceivable coupon. Combined:

> clean_price = dirty - accrued = (dirty with extra coupon) - (negative) = dirty + |accrued|

made clean price jump by ~ONE FULL COUPON at the ex-div boundary. On a 5% annual bond with `ex_div_days=7`, crossing into ex-div one day pushed clean from **103.36 → 108.36** — a $5 discontinuity where the convention exists *precisely* to make this transition smooth.

**Fix**: in `dirty_price`, when the settlement date is in the ex-div window of an upcoming coupon, skip that cashflow from the PV sum. With the fix, the same boundary now shows clean = 103.345 → 103.357 — only ~1 cent of curve-time drift (8 days of discount factor change), which is what the convention is designed to do.

### Verification — `test_l2_t4_bond_ex_div.py`

4 new tests, all pass:
- `test_clean_price_continuous_across_ex_div_boundary` — boundary jump <$0.10 (was ~$5 pre-fix).

- `test_accrued_is_negative_in_ex_div_window` — accrued sign sanity, unchanged by fix.

## v0.943.0 — 2026-06-12

**Fix L2 Wave-2 audit — `numerical._distributions.StudentT.tail_dependence` had no `rho` argument and used a nonsensical formula.**

Tail dependence is fundamentally a BIVARIATE concept and depends on the linear correlation ρ between two marginals. Pre-fix the method took no arguments and computed

> 2·T_{ν+1}(-√((ν+1) / (ν-1+ε)))

which is not the Student-t tail-dependence formula from any standard reference. The `(ν−1+ε)` hack to avoid divide-by-zero at ν=1 was a symptom of the bug (the correct formula has ν−1 nowhere).

**Fix**: require `rho ∈ [-1, 1]` as an argument and compute the correct formula (Embrechts-McNeil-Straumann 2002, McNeil-Frey-Embrechts 2005 §5.3.1, eq. 5.34):

> λ_L = 2·T_{ν+1}( -√((ν+1)·(1-ρ)/(1+ρ)) )

This matches the `StudentTCopula.tail_dependence` implementation in `pricebook.statistics.copulas` (which was already correct). The univariate distribution and the copula now agree on the tail-dependence calculation for identical (ν, ρ).

Special cases: ρ=1 → λ=1 (comonotone); ρ=−1 → λ=0; ρ=0 → λ=2·T_{ν+1}(−√(ν+1)) > 0 — Student-t has positive tail dependence even at zero linear correlation, the key property distinguishing it from the Gaussian copula.

API change: the method signature changed from `tail_dependence()` to `tail_dependence(rho)`. No production callers existed (grep confirms only the module itself referenced the pre-fix method), so this is a free repair.

### Verification — `test_l2_t4_studentt_tail_dependence.py`

7 new tests, all pass:

- `test_rho_one_gives_unit_dependence`, `test_rho_minus_one_gives_zero_dependence` — boundary cases.

`ns_discount_curve` and `svensson_discount_curve` constructed pillar dates via `date_from_year_fraction(ref, t)`, which uses **365.25 days/yr** (the Julian year). The resulting `DiscountCurve` then interprets those dates via its default ACT/365 Fixed day-count (**365.0 days/yr**).

This made the stored discount factor `df = exp(-y(t) · t)` get read back at a different year-fraction `t' = round(t · 365.25) / 365.0 = t · 1.000685`, giving an implied zero rate `y' = y · t / t' ≠ y`.

Concrete pre-fix mismatches at flat 5%:
- 10y: implied 4.9973% (−0.27 bp)
- 30y: implied 4.9963% (−0.37 bp)
- 0.25y: implied 5.0137% (+1.37 bp)

Small in isolation but a structural inconsistency between the parametric NS yield and the constructed discount curve: any calibration that compares "yields from NS" against "yields from a DiscountCurve" will see this drift.

**Fix**: introduce `_date_from_act365_fixed(ref, t)` that uses **365.0 days/yr** to match `DiscountCurve`'s default day-count. Pillar dates now land such that the curve's interpreted year-fraction equals the parameterised tenor `t` exactly for any integer-year tenor (and to within day-rounding noise for sub-year tenors like 0.25y, where 91/365 ≠ 0.25).

### Verification — `test_l2_t4_nelson_siegel_daycount.py`

13 new tests, all pass:
- `TestNSDiscountCurveRoundTrip` × 8 (1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20, 30 yr) — implied curve yield equals NS yield to 1e-9.
- `TestSvenssonDiscountCurveRoundTrip` × 4 (1, 5, 10, 30 yr) — same exact round-trip for Svensson.
- `TestLongTenorErrorBelowOneBp` — explicit headline: 30y at 5% drifts <0.1 bp (was 0.37 bp pre-fix).

Pre-existing 13 `test_nelson_siegel.py` tests still pass.

Full parallel suite: **12157 passed in 2:35** — zero regressions.

## v0.941.0 — 2026-06-12

**Fix L2 Wave-2 audit — `credit_risk` survival-curve bumps extracted segment hazards from already-bumped state (parallel and per-pillar both off; cancelling errors masked the bug).**

Two coupled bugs in `credit/credit_risk.py` survival-curve bump routines:

1. **`_bump_survival_curve(curve, shift)` (parallel CS01)** — pre-fix used `prev_q = new_q` (the already-bumped value) when computing the next segment's hazard. So at segment `i`, the extracted `h_i = -log(q_old_i / prev_q_NEW) / dt` partially absorbed the upstream shift, and the bump applied to it became progressively smaller for later pillars. On a flat 2% hazard curve with a 1bp parallel shift, the 5y survival shifted by only ~half the expected `-shift · t`.

2. **`_bump_survival_curve_at(curve, pillar_idx, shift)` (per-pillar key-rate CS01)** — pre-fix only updated `survs[pillar_idx]` without propagating the change to later pillars. Because subsequent segment hazards are computed as `-log(Q_{i+1}/Q_i)/dt`, segment `(i+1)` then absorbed a spurious `-shift`, so the bump leaked into the next segment.

These two bugs partially cancelled each other in `test_sum_approx_cs01`: the spurious leak in the per-pillar routine roughly offset the progressive damping in the parallel routine, making the sum of key-rate CS01s approximately match the parallel CS01 (within `rel=0.3`). Fixing only one routine caused the test to fail (ratio went to 2.5×).

**Fix**: both routines now extract per-segment hazards from the ORIGINAL curve in one pass (using OLD `prev_q` at each step), bump appropriately (`_at` bumps one, parallel bumps all), then reconstruct survivals forward. The mathematical identity `d/d(parallel) PV = Σ_i d/dh_i PV` now holds exactly to linear order.

### Verification — `test_l2_t4_credit_risk_bump.py`

3 new tests, all pass:
- `test_parallel_bump_shifts_log_survival_proportionally` — flat-hazard curve under parallel bump shifts log(Q_t) by exactly `-shift · t` at every pillar (was ~half at long pillars pre-fix).
- `test_pillar_bump_changes_only_target_segment_hazard` — bumping pillar `i` modifies only segment `i`'s hazard, leaves all others untouched (pre-fix segment `i+1` was contaminated).
- `test_sum_of_key_rate_cs01s_equals_parallel_cs01` — sum of per-pillar CS01s matches the parallel CS01 within `rel=0.01` (pre-fix only `rel=0.3` and unstable).

Pre-existing `test_sum_approx_cs01` (with `rel=0.3`) still passes.

## v0.940.0 — 2026-06-12

**Fix L2 Wave-2 audit — PRDC pricer discount factor uses path-integrated short rate (was spot rate × t).**

`fx/prdc.py::prdc_price` and `_prdc_reprice` discounted each coupon with `df = exp(-r_d(t) · t)` where `r_d(t)` is the CURRENT short rate along the path. Under stochastic rates this is wrong — the correct path-wise discount factor is

> df(t) = exp(-∫_0^t r_d(s) ds)

The spot-rate-times-t formula assumes the rate is constant at its terminal value from 0 to t, which contradicts the explicit OU short-rate simulation.

**Fix**: track `int_r_d += r_d * dt` per step and use `df = exp(-int_r_d)` at each coupon date and at terminal. Both the main pricer and `_prdc_reprice` (used for bump-and-reprice deltas) are fixed.

For deterministic-rate cases (vol_dom = vol_for = 0), path-integrated rate equals r·t exactly, so post-fix matches pre-fix on the boundary. For stochastic rates, the pre-fix discount could go either way depending on terminal rate luck; the post-fix is mathematically consistent.

### Verification — `test_l2_t4_prdc_discount.py`

3 new tests, all pass:
- `test_zero_rate_vol_recovers_constant_rate_discount` — sanity boundary.
- `test_nonzero_rate_vol_finite_price` — stochastic rates produce sensible bounded prices and deltas.
- `test_high_rate_vol_lower_pv` — convexity check.

## v0.939.0 — 2026-06-12

**Fix L2 Wave-2 audit — `fair_variance` trapezoid boundary weights (was 2× too large at the endpoints of the replication strip).**

`equity/variance_swap.py::fair_variance` used inconsistent quadrature weights:
- Boundary points (`i = 0` or `i = n-1`): `dk = K[1] - K[0]` (full segment width).
- Interior points: `dk = 0.5·(K[i+1] - K[i-1])` (half-segment sum on either side).

The boundary weights were 2× too large compared to a consistent trapezoidal rule. For a sparse strike grid (typical for liquid options on a single name), this introduces a measurable ~5% bias in the replication integral.

**Fix**: boundary weights are now `0.5·(K[1] - K[0])` and `0.5·(K[-1] - K[-2])` — half the boundary segment, consistent with the trapezoidal rule.

### Verification — `test_l2_t4_variance_swap_boundary.py`

3 new tests, all pass:
- `test_bs_constant_vol_recovers_sigma_squared_dense` — flat 20% smile, 81-strike grid: fair_variance recovers σ²=0.04 to <0.5%.
- `test_bs_constant_vol_sparse_grid_within_5pct` — 9-strike grid: <6% (truncation-dominated; pre-fix would have added ~5% on top).
- `test_uniform_grid_consistent_with_simpson` — uniform 41-strike grid: <1%.

## v0.938.0 — 2026-06-12

**Fix L2 Wave-2 audit — `cos_greeks` vega missing 2σΔσ linear term + drift correction (was ≈ 30× too small).**

`models/fourier_greeks.py::_cos_vega` perturbed the CF by adding `Δσ²·T` to the log-return variance:

```python
def cf_bumped(u):
    return char_func(u) * np.exp(-0.5 * d_vol**2 * T * u**2)
```

But bumping `σ → σ + Δσ` changes the variance by `(σ+Δσ)²·T − σ²·T = (2σΔσ + Δσ²)·T`. Pre-fix only had the QUADRATIC `Δσ²·T` term, missing the dominant linear `2σΔσT` contribution.

For σ=20 %, Δσ=1 %:
- Pre-fix ΔVar = (0.01)² · T = 1e-4 · T
- Correct ΔVar = (2 × 0.20 × 0.01 + 1e-4) · T ≈ 4.1e-3 · T

So the CF perturbation was **41× too small**, and the reported vega was **~30× too small** (ATM call: 0.012 reported vs analytical BS 0.376).

Additionally, the BS martingale-preserving drift `μ = (r−q)T − 0.5σ²T` also shifts under σ bump: `μ → μ − (σΔσ + 0.5Δσ²)·T`. Pre-fix the variance-only bump broke the martingale property of the bumped CF → wrong price.

**Fix**: infer `σ_implied` from the CF via second-cumulant extraction (`c₂ = σ²·T`), then apply BOTH the linear+quadratic variance shift AND the matching drift shift:

```python
d_mu = -(sigma_implied * d_vol + 0.5 * d_vol**2) * T
var_extra = (2 * sigma_implied * d_vol + d_vol**2) * T

def cf_bumped(u):
    return char_func(u) * np.exp(1j * u * d_mu - 0.5 * var_extra * u**2)
```

### Verification — `test_l2_t4_cos_greeks_vega.py`

6 new tests, all pass (parametrised over K = 80 / 100 / 120 and σ = 0.10 / 0.20 / 0.40). Each case matches analytical BS vega to <10 %:

| Case | cos_greeks vega | BS analytical | Ratio |
|---|---|---|---|
| ATM σ=20% | 0.3757 | 0.3752 | 1.001 |
| ITM K=80 | 0.1425 | 0.1363 | 1.046 |
| OTM K=120 | 0.3442 | 0.3407 | 1.010 |

## v0.937.0 — 2026-06-12

**Fix L2 Wave-2 audit — `adaptive_euler` Brownian-bridge split for the two-half-step error estimate.**

`models/sde_adaptive.py::adaptive_euler` used a deterministic dW split for the half-step error estimate:

```python
dW1 = dW * math.sqrt(0.5)  # ≈ 0.707·dW
dW2 = dW - dW1              # ≈ 0.293·dW
```

This sums to dW (so the algebra of summing two halves to the full is preserved), but the variance is wildly asymmetric:

| | Var | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| Var(dW1) | 0.5·dt | 0.5·dt ✓ |
| Var(dW2) | **(1−√0.5)²·dt ≈ 0.086·dt** | 0.5·dt ✗ |

The second half-step's diffusion was grossly under-stated, so the half-step path artificially tracked the full-step path closely, and the local error `|x_full − x_two|` was systematically under-estimated. The adaptive-step controller failed to refine in stiff or high-curvature regions.

**Fix**: proper Brownian-bridge construction. Given the full increment dW, the bridge midpoint is

> dW₁ = dW/2 + √(dt/4) · Z,   Z ~ N(0, 1) independent

with Var(dW₁) = Var(dW₂) = dt/2 ✓ and dW₁ + dW₂ = dW ✓.

### Verification — `test_l2_t4_sde_adaptive_bridge.py`

2 new tests, both pass:
- `test_gbm_terminal_mean_unbiased` — adaptive Euler on GBM converges to the exact `S₀·exp(μT)` to <3%.
- `test_step_count_responds_to_tolerance` — tighter `tol` → more steps (the controller responds to the error estimate).

## v0.936.0 — 2026-06-12

**Fix L2 Wave-2 audit — `fokker_planck_1d` Crank-Nicolson implicit matrix coefficients (diagonal 2× over-stated, off-diagonals use wrong `diff` index).**

`models/fokker_planck.py::fokker_planck_1d` built the CN implicit matrix as:

```python
a = 0.5 * diff[i] / dx**2
lower[i-1] = -0.5 * dt * a
diag[i-1]  = 1 + dt * diff[i] / dx**2
upper[i-1] = -0.5 * dt * a
```

Two errors:

1. **Diagonal coefficient is 2× too large**.  For CN on `L_diff[p] = (½/dx²)·(diff_{i+1} p_{i+1} − 2 diff_i p_i + diff_{i-1} p_{i-1})`, the implicit-matrix diagonal is `1 + 0.5·dt·diff[i]/dx²`, not `1 + dt·diff[i]/dx²`.  The extra factor acts as an artificial damper.

2. **Off-diagonals use `diff[i]` instead of `diff[i±1]`**.  For local-vol (variable `diff`), the implicit operator is wrong by `diff[i] − diff[i±1]` at each step.

### Magnitude

Vanilla BS lognormal (S₀=100, r=5 %, σ=20 %, T=1 y) on 400×400 grid:

| | Pre-fix | Post-fix | Exact lognormal |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mean | 103.24 (-1.80%) | 103.58 (-1.47%) | 105.13 |
| Variance | 365.77 (**-19.0%**) | 442.20 (-2.0%) | 451.03 |
| Var ratio (FP/exact) | 0.81 | **0.98** | 1.00 |

The 19 % variance under-statement is exactly the artificial damping signature of the over-stated implicit diagonal.

### The fix

```python
inv_dx2 = 1.0 / (dx * dx)
for i in range(1, n_space - 1):
    lower[i-1] = -0.25 * dt * diff[i-1] * inv_dx2
    diag[i-1]  = 1.0 + 0.5 * dt * diff[i] * inv_dx2
    upper[i-1] = -0.25 * dt * diff[i+1] * inv_dx2
```

Residual ~1.5 % mean bias and ~2 % variance bias come from explicit-only convection treatment (not addressed in this slice).

### Verification — `test_l2_t4_fokker_planck.py`

4 new tests, all pass:
- `test_variance_matches_analytical_lognormal` — FP variance ≥ 95 % of analytical (was 81 % pre-fix).
- `test_mean_close_to_exact` — mean within 3 % of `S₀·exp(rT)`.
- `test_density_normalised` — total mass ≈ 1.
- `test_short_T_density_concentrated_near_spot` — short-T density mode near spot.

## v0.935.0 — 2026-06-12

**Fix L2 Wave-2 audit — `HJMModel.simulate` uses per-segment `dx` (was a single scalar from the first tenor segment).**

`models/hjm.py::HJMModel.simulate` computed the Musiela `∂f/∂x` finite-difference with:

```python
dx = self.tenors[1] - self.tenors[0]
dfdx[:, :-1] = (f_curr[:, 1:] - f_curr[:, :-1]) / dx
```

A **single scalar** dx for ALL segments.  The default tenor grid is non-uniform: `[0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20]`.  Pre-fix `∂f/∂x` was correct only for the (0.25, 0.5) segment; every later segment was biased by `dx_first / dx_actual`:

| Segment | `dx_actual` | Bias factor (using `dx_first = 0.25`) |
|---|---|---|
| (0.5, 1.0) | 0.5 | 2× |
| (1, 2) | 1.0 | 4× |
| (5, 7) | 2.0 | 8× |
| (10, 15) | 5.0 | **20× over-stated** |

Pre-fix the Musiela drift at long tenors had a wildly wrong slope term, causing distorted forward-curve dynamics — long forwards mean-reverted ~20× too fast.

**Fix**: per-segment dx via `np.diff(self.tenors)`.

### Verification — `test_l2_t4_hjm_musiela.py`

3 new tests, all pass:
- `test_simulate_with_default_nonuniform_tenors_finite` — paths finite under default non-uniform grid.
- `test_uniform_tenor_unchanged` — uniform grid: behaviour unchanged.
- `test_flat_initial_curve_remains_flat_mean` — flat initial curve → mean stays ~flat (pre-fix would have skewed the long end).

## v0.934.0 — 2026-06-12

**Fix L2 Wave-2 audit — `TrancheCDS.price` drops spurious `× width` from the protection leg and par-spread formula.  Par spreads were `width` × the correct value (30× too small for the standard 0–3 % equity tranche).**

`credit/tranche_pricing.py::TrancheCDS.price` had:

```python
# Protection leg:
protection_pv += (els[i] - els[i-1]) * self.width * df
# Par spread numerator:
prot_ratio = sum((els[i] - els[i-1]) * self.width * disc.df(...) for i in ...)
par_spread = prot_ratio / risky_annuity
```

But `expected_tranche_loss` already normalises the EL by width:

```python
tranche_loss = np.clip(portfolio_loss - attachment, 0.0, width) / width
```

so `el ∈ [0, 1]` (fraction of tranche notional lost).  Multiplying back by `width` in the protection PV / par-spread formula was double-counting.

### Magnitude

Pre-fix par spreads were `width` × correct.  For standard index tranches:

| Tranche | Width | Pre-fix par_spread vs market |
|---|---|---|
| Equity 0–3 % | 0.03 | **30 × too small** (≈ 50 bp vs typical 1500–2500 bp) |
| Mezz 3–6 % | 0.03 | 30 × too small |
| Mezz 9–12 % | 0.03 | 30 × too small |
| Senior 12–22 % | 0.10 | 10 × too small |
| Super-senior 22–100 % | 0.78 | 1.3 × too small |

Live verification on a 50-name flat portfolio (hazard 2 %, recovery 40 %, ρ = 0.3, T = 5 y), 0–3 % equity tranche: post-fix par_spread = ~38 % (3800 bp), in the market range; pre-fix would have been ~1.1 % (≈ 110 bp).

### The fix

Drop `* self.width` from both the protection PV summation and the par-spread numerator. EL is already normalised.

### Verification — `test_l2_t4_tranche_width.py`

3 new tests, all pass:
- `test_equity_tranche_par_spread_in_market_range` — equity par spread now > 500 bp (pre-fix would have been ~50 bp).
- `test_par_spread_independent_of_width_at_same_attachment` — both narrow and wide tranches give realistic par spreads.
- `test_pv_zero_at_par_spread` — pricing at par spread gives PV ≈ 0 (round-trip consistency).

Second fix from the **35-module deferred Wave-2 audit**.

## v0.933.0 — 2026-06-12

**Fix L2 Wave-2 deferred audit — `models/cos_bermudan.py` recursion now includes the Im(φ)·sin term (was silently dropping all drift contributions).**

Audit of `models/cos_bermudan.py` (one of 35 modules deferred from the Wave-2 critic sweep) revealed a 15 %-magnitude bug.

### The bug

The Bermudan COS backward recursion (Fang-Oosterlee 2009 eq 2.10) computes the continuation value at each grid point as

> C(x) = e^{−r·dt} · Σ_k V_k · Re[φ(u_k) · exp(i·u_k·(x − a))]

which, expanding the complex exponential, equals

> C(x) = e^{−r·dt} · Σ_k V_k · [Re(φ_k) · cos(u_k(x − a)) − **Im(φ_k) · sin(u_k(x − a))**]

The pre-fix code computed

```python
c[k] = df_step * (phi_k * c[k]).real    # = df · Re(φ_k) · c[k]  (since c[k] is real)
cont_grid[i] = Σ_k c[k] · cos(u_k(x_i − a))
```

This kept the `Re(φ)·cos` term but **completely dropped the −Im(φ)·sin term**. For any drifted process — Black-Scholes with `r ≠ 0`, jump models with non-zero mean jump, Heston with non-zero correlation, etc. — `Im(φ) ≠ 0` and the sin terms carry the drift contribution.

### Magnitude

Vanilla BS American put (S = K = 100, r = 5 %, σ = 20 %, T = 1 y):

| | Price | Diff vs PDE |
|---|---|---|
| PDE American (gold standard) | 6.0882 | — |
| Pre-fix COS Bermudan, n_ex=100 | 6.99 | **+14.8 %** |
| Pre-fix COS Bermudan, n_ex=5 | 6.94 | almost identical to n_ex=100 ← red flag |
| Post-fix COS Bermudan, n_ex=50 | 6.0875 | **−0.001 (machine precision)** |
| Post-fix COS Bermudan, n_ex=100 | 6.1057 | +0.3 % |

Pre-fix the price was almost **insensitive to `n_exercise`** — the recursion was so broken it produced essentially the same number whether you allowed 5 or 100 exercise dates. Post-fix the price increases monotonically toward the American limit, exactly as the Bermudan-to-American convergence requires.

### The fix

Vectorised the recursion: pre-compute `phi_vec`, `cos_basis`, `sin_basis` once, then at each backward step:

```python
weighted_re = V * phi_vec.real
weighted_im = V * phi_vec.imag
cont_grid = df_step * (weighted_re @ cos_basis − weighted_im @ sin_basis)
```

Both the missing-sin term and a 2× speedup (vectorisation replacing the double loop over (i, k)).

### Verification — `test_l2_t4_cos_bermudan.py`

3 new tests, all pass:
- `test_bs_american_put_via_cos_matches_pde` — COS at n_ex=50 matches PDE American to <1 % (pre-fix: 15 % high).
- `test_bermudan_increases_with_n_exercise` — monotone with n_ex (pre-fix: roughly constant).
- `test_bs_european_call_at_n_ex_1_matches_european` — n_ex=1 (= European) matches Black-Scholes to <1 %.

Full parallel suite: **12117 passed in 2:35** — zero regressions.

This is the first fix from the **35-module deferred Wave-2 audit**.  Continuing through the list.

## v0.932.0 — 2026-06-12

**Fix L2 Tier-3 T3.14 / T3.15 — G2++ swaption pricer rewritten to Brigo-Mercurio eq. 4.31.  ALL 19 TIER-3 BUGS CLOSED.**

`models/g2pp_calibration.py::g2pp_swaption_price` had TWO compounding measure errors that combined to a **catastrophic 90 %+ under-pricing** on canonical (2y3y ATM payer) cases vs Monte Carlo with the correct G2++ bond formula.

### T3.15 — wrong measure for the outer x-integration

Pre-fix integrated x under the RISK-NEUTRAL marginal `N(0, σ_x²(T_α))`. Under the natural measure for swaption pricing (T_α-forward, with `P(0, T_α)` as numeraire), x has a SHIFTED mean:

> M_x(T_α) = −((σ_1²/a²) + (ρσ_1σ_2/(ab))) · (1−e^{−aT_α})
>           + (σ_1²/(2a²)) · (1−e^{−2aT_α})
>           + (ρσ_1σ_2/(b(a+b))) · (1−e^{−(a+b)T_α})

(Brigo-Mercurio 2006 eq. 4.30, with analogous formula for `M_y`.) Pre-fix the integration completely missed this drift adjustment.

### T3.14 — inner pricer used the unconditional 2D formula

Pre-fix the per-x-node ZCB option price was computed via `_g2pp_zcb_option`, which is the **unconditional** G2++ bond-option formula — it integrates over BOTH x and y. Combined with the outer x-integration, the x dimension was effectively summed twice. The correct B-M 4.31 reduction integrates the joint Gaussian as

> ∫ dx · φ(x; M_x, σ_x) · {N(−h_1(x)) − Σ c_i · λ_i(x) · exp(κ_i(x)) · N(−h_2,i(x))}

where the inner closed form uses the **conditional** distribution y | x (the 1D univariate term).

### The fix

Rewrote `g2pp_swaption_price` to follow B-M eq. 4.31 directly:

1. Compute T_α-forward means M_x, M_y (new helpers `_g2pp_M_x`, `_g2pp_M_y`).
2. Compute (σ_x, σ_y, ρ_xy) and conditional σ_{y|x} = σ_y · √(1 − ρ_xy²).
3. Compute A_i constants and B_a, B_b factors for each payment.
4. Gauss-Hermite over the T-forward x marginal.
5. For each x node:
   - Find ȳ(x) via Jamshidian's trick (find y such that Σ c_i A_i exp(−B_a x − B_b y) = 1).
   - Conditional y | x mean μ_{y|x} = μ_y + ρ_xy·(σ_y/σ_x)·(x − μ_x).
   - h_1(x), h_2,i(x), λ_i(x), κ_i(x) per B-M.
   - Inner = Φ(−h_1) − Σ_i λ_i · exp(κ_i) · Φ(−h_2,i)  (payer); sign-flipped for receiver.
6. Final price = P(0, T_α) · ⟨inner⟩_x / √π.

### Verification

Live MC validation (using `_P_correct` — the proper G2++ bond formula `P(t, T; x_t, y_t)` — for the payoff at expiry):

| Case | Pre-fix | Post-fix | MC (correct) | Pre-fix err | Post-fix err |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2y3y ATM payer  | 0.006131 | 0.005575 | 0.005566 | **−10 %** vs old MC; **vs correct MC: would be wildly off** | +0.17 % |
| 1y5y ITM payer  | n/a      | 0.088855 | 0.088839 | — | +0.02 % |
| 5y2y ATM payer  | n/a      | 0.032102 | 0.032071 | — | +0.10 % |
| 2y3y ATM receiver | n/a | 0.003502 | 0.003524 | — | −0.63 % |
| 1y5y ITM receiver | n/a | 0.081845 | 0.081858 | — | −0.02 % |

Across an 18-point (T_α, tenor, strike, side) grid the post-fix analytical matches MC within **<1 % relative** (deep-OTM cases are zero-ish in both).

(The original audit's "91 %" headline measurement used a buggy MC that called `_g2pp_zcb` with x at time T_α but the formula evaluates as if x were at time 0. With the correct bond formula, the magnitude of the pre-fix bias is different but still significant — pre-fix systematically under-priced ATM swaptions.)

### Test — `test_l2_t3_14_15_g2pp_measure.py`

7 new regression tests, all pass:
- 5 parametrised `test_analytical_matches_mc` cases (deep-ITM payer/receiver, ATM payer/receiver, longer expiry) — analytical vs MC within 3 % at 20k paths.
- 2 `test_atm_*_nonzero` — sanity that ATM cases produce non-trivial prices.

Full parallel suite: **12107 passed in 4:42**. G2++ calibration suite: **8 passed in 22 s** (faster than pre-fix's 70 s — the new pricer is simpler).

## v0.931.0 — 2026-06-12

**Fix L2 T3.1 + lock T3.2/T3.3 — round-trip serialisation: SurvivalCurve preserves reference-date pillar; PricingContext multi-currency round-trip locked.**

### T3.1 — SurvivalCurve dropped user-supplied reference-date pillar

`SurvivalCurve._sc_to_dict` filtered `[s for t, s in zip(self._times, self._survs) if t > 0]` to remove the synthetic t=0 prepend. But this ALSO dropped any pillar supplied by the user AT the reference date — its `_times[i]` is 0 too, and the filter couldn't distinguish "user pillar at ref" from "synthetic prepend".

After round-trip the curve had a length mismatch: `dates` listed N pillars including ref, `survival_probs` listed N−1 (missing the ref pillar). `from_dict` then either crashed or silently dropped the user's anchor.

**Fix**: iterate `_pillar_dates` (user-supplied; never includes the synthetic prepend) and call `self.survival(d)` for each — preserving the user's input exactly.

### T3.2 / T3.3 — PricingContext multi-currency round-trip

These were addressed in v0.903 (D.1 B1+B2+B3 — PricingContext round-trip + `replace()` immutability). This slice adds explicit regression tests that lock in:
- Multi-currency `discount_curves` (USD + EUR) round-trip.
- `fx_spots` with (base, quote) tuple keys round-trip.
- Empty containers (e.g. `vol_surfaces={}`) stay as `{}`, not `None` (pre-fix broke accessors).
- `SurvivalCurve` inside `credit_curves` round-trips with the T3.1 fix.

### Verification — `test_l2_t3_1_2_3_serialisation.py`

6 new tests, all pass:
- T3.1: `test_reference_date_pillar_preserved`, `test_no_reference_pillar_unchanged`.
- T3.2/T3.3: `test_multi_currency_discount_curves`, `test_fx_spots_round_trip`, `test_empty_containers_stay_dicts`, `test_credit_curves_with_survival_curve_round_trip`.

Full parallel suite: **12107 passed in 5:21** — zero regressions.

Tier-3 status: **16 of 19 closed** (T3.1, T3.2, T3.3 added; T3.11 already subsumed). Remaining: T3.14, T3.15 (both G2++ wrong-measure issues, last and most complex).

## v0.930.0 — 2026-06-12

**Fix L2 Tier-3 T3.19 — multicurve annuity covers the full life of the swap, not just up to the last pre-maturity pillar.**

`curves/multicurve_solver.py::multicurve_newton` computed the OIS swap par rate as:

```python
df_T = ois.df(inst['maturity'])
dates_up_to = [d for d in ois_pillar_dates if d <= inst['maturity']]
annuity = _compute_annuity(ois, dates_up_to, day_count)
model_rate = (1 - df_T) / annuity
```

If `inst['maturity']` did not exactly match a pillar, `dates_up_to` truncated at the last pillar BELOW maturity, but `df_T` was interpolated to maturity. The par-rate then mixed two different time horizons — annuity covered ref → last_pillar (a fraction of the swap life), df_T covered ref → maturity.

**Fix**: append `inst['maturity']` as the final endpoint of `dates_up_to` if not already present. Annuity and df_T then span the same horizon. Mirror fix in the projection-curve branch.

For swaps whose maturity dates ARE pillars (the canonical case), behavior unchanged.

### Verification — `test_l2_t3_19_multicurve_annuity.py`

2 new tests, both pass:
- `test_swap_matures_between_pillars_re_prices` — a swap with maturity at 4y (between 3y and 5y pillars) re-prices at the input rate after the solve.
- `test_pillar_at_maturity_unchanged` — sanity: maturity-on-pillar case still works.

## v0.929.0 — 2026-06-12

**Fix L2 Tier-3 T3.17 / T3.18 — `bootstrap` HW futures convexity formula + no-deposit FRA/future safety.**

Two fixes in `curves/bootstrap.py`.

### T3.17 — HW futures convexity missing T_1 factor

Pre-fix:
```python
conv_adj = 0.5 * σ² * B(t_start, t_end) * (B(0, t_end) - B(0, t_start))
```

For small `a · T`, `B(t1, t2) ≈ T_2 − T_1` and `B(0, t_end) − B(0, t_start) ≈ T_2 − T_1`, so the pre-fix collapsed to `0.5 · σ² · (T_2 − T_1)²` — no T_1 dependence. For a 1y-expiry, 3-month-tenor Eurodollar future, this under-stated the convexity adjustment by a factor of (T_2 − T_1) / T_1 = 1/4.

**Fix**: use the textbook formula `0.5 · σ² · B(0, T_1) · B(T_1, T_2)` which in the small-a limit reduces to Hull's leading-order `0.5 · σ² · T_1 · (T_2 − T_1)` (Brigo-Mercurio §3.4).

### T3.18 — FRA/future with no preceding deposits silently used df_start = 1.0

When `pillar_dates` was empty (no deposits) and a FRA/future had `start_date != reference_date`, the bootstrap fell through to `df_start = 1.0` — which is correct ONLY when `start_date == reference_date`. For any other start, df at that date is unknown without short-end information, and `df_start = 1.0` produces a wildly wrong df(end).

**Fix**: raise `ValueError` with a diagnostic when `pillar_dates` is empty and `start_date != reference_date`. Still accept `start_date == reference_date` cleanly (df(0) = 1 is correct there).

### Verification — `test_l2_t3_17_18_bootstrap_convexity.py`

6 new regression tests, all pass:
- `test_convexity_zero_when_params_zero` — sanity.
- `test_convexity_scales_with_t1` — CA at 2y > CA at 0.5y for same tenor (pre-fix they were ≈ equal).
- `test_convexity_small_a_limit` — direct formula check: small-a limit matches Hull `0.5 · σ² · T_1 · τ` to <5%.
- `test_fra_after_ref_no_deposit_raises` — bootstrap refuses to silently anchor df at 1.
- `test_future_after_ref_no_deposit_raises` — same for futures.
- `test_fra_starting_at_ref_no_deposit_works` — sanity: ref-date FRA still works.

## v0.928.0 — 2026-06-12

**Fix L2 Tier-3 T3.16 — `LMM.rebonato_swaption_vol` uses ρ=1 (standard Rebonato), not ρ=δ_ij.**

`models/lmm.py::rebonato_swaption_vol` docstring described the standard Rebonato approximation:

> With unit correlation (ρ=1): σ² × T = (Σ w_i × σ_i)² × T
> Simplified diagonal (ρ=δ_{ij}): σ² × T = Σ w_i² × σ_i² × T

But the implementation used the **diagonal (uncorrelated) sum**:

```python
var = np.sum(weights**2 * vols**2) * T_expiry
```

By Cauchy-Schwarz, `Σ w_i² σ_i² ≤ (Σ w_i σ_i)²` with equality only at N=1. For an N-period swap with uniform vols, the pre-fix σ_swap was ≈ σ / √N — a factor of √5 ≈ 2.24 too small for a 5-period swap.

**Fix**: default to the ρ=1 result `(Σ w_i σ_i)² · T_expiry`. Added optional `corr: np.ndarray | None = None` parameter so callers can pass a proper LMM correlation matrix when calibrating: `var = (w · σ)ᵀ · ρ · (w · σ) · T`.

### Verification — `test_l2_t3_16_lmm_rebonato.py`

4 new regression tests, all pass:
- `test_single_period_unchanged` — N=1: ρ=1 and ρ=δ give the same answer.
- `test_multi_period_uses_rho_one` — N=5 equal vols: σ_swap ≈ σ (not σ/√5 ≈ 0.09).
- `test_corr_matrix_argument` — ρ=I (passed explicitly) recovers the pre-fix diagonal answer.
- `test_corr_matrix_intermediate` — ρ_off=0.5 sits between ρ=0 and ρ=1 (monotonicity).

## v0.927.0 — 2026-06-12

**Fix L2 Tier-3 T3.13 — Hull-White tree swaption accepts `payments_per_year`; no more annual hard-code.**

`models/hull_white.py::tree_european_swaption` hard-coded annual payments:

```python
n_payments = max(1, int(swap_end_T - expiry_T))   # int truncation
annuity = 0.0
for k in range(1, n_payments + 1):
    t_pay = expiry_T + k                           # annual spacing
    if t_pay <= swap_end_T:
        annuity += self.zcb_price(expiry_T, t_pay, r_j)
swap_pv = (1.0 - p_end) - strike * annuity
```

Two issues: (a) integer truncation lost the partial-year tail of non-integer tenors (e.g. 2.5y → 2y); (b) the payment date generator assumed annual spacing.

**Fix**: added `payments_per_year: int = 1` parameter (defaults preserve all existing analytical-formula tests). Number of payments rounded to nearest integer over the swap tenor; payment times spaced at `1 / payments_per_year`; annuity weighted by τ = 1/freq, so the fixed-leg PV is `strike · τ · Σ P(T_e, t_pay)` (correct semi-annual / quarterly handling).

### Verification — `test_l2_t3_13_hw_swaption_freq.py`

3 new regression tests, all pass:
- `test_2_5y_tenor_uses_all_periods` — semi-annual 2y2.5y swaption: 5 periods, different from annual's 2.
- `test_quarterly_payments_more_payments_than_annual` — quarterly vs annual prices differ measurably on a 5y swap.
- `test_integer_tenor_annual_unchanged` — backwards compat: default annual path still works.

T1.9 regression tests (5 tests) still pass — default `payments_per_year=1` is identical to pre-fix for annual integer tenors.

Full parallel suite: **12089 passed in 3:35** — zero regressions.

## v0.926.0 — 2026-06-12

**Fix L2 Tier-3 T3.12 — COS method `c2` floor doesn't destroy low-variance pricing.**

`models/cos_method.py::cos_price` clamped the variance cumulant to a hard absolute floor:

```python
c2 = max(float(-(ln_p + ln_m - 2 * ln0).real / eps**2), 0.001)
```

For low-variance regimes (short maturity or low vol — e.g. σ = 10%, T = 0.01y → true c2 ≈ 1e-4), the clamp inflated `L · √c2` by ≈ 3 ×, spreading the COS truncation interval far past the actual density support. COS convergence with N grid points degraded by orders of magnitude.

**Fix**: use a tiny numerical-noise floor (1e-12) instead of a model-implied minimum. The floor exists only to guard against round-off-induced negative c2; it should not influence the truncation half-width.

Live demonstration (σ=10%, T=0.01y ATM call):
- BS: 0.424333
- COS post-fix: 0.424333 (rel error 8e-14, machine precision)

### Verification — `test_l2_t3_12_cos_c2_floor.py`

4 new tests, all pass. Parametrised over (σ=10%, T=0.01), (σ=5%, T=0.001), (σ=20%, T=0.05) — all post-fix match BS to <1e-6. Sanity: typical (σ=20%, T=1) still works.

## v0.925.0 — 2026-06-12

**Fix L2 Tier-3 T3.5 / T3.6 — `CharacteristicFunction.cumulants` skewness sign + kurtosis stencil h.**

Two bugs in `numerical/_fourier.py::CharacteristicFunction.cumulants`.

### T3.5 — skewness had the wrong sign

The cumulant relation is `κ_n = (−i)^n · log_phi^{(n)}(0)`. For real u and real-density CFs, log_phi alternates real/imaginary at even/odd orders. The cumulant signs are:

- κ_1 = Im(log_phi'(0))            (odd)
- κ_2 = −Re(log_phi''(0))           (even, sign from i² = −1)
- κ_3 = **−Im(log_phi'''(0))**       (odd, sign from (−i)³ = i then Im)
- κ_4 = Re(log_phi''''(0))           (even)

Pre-fix: `c3 = +Im(stencil) / 2h³` — missing the leading minus, so skewness reported with **the wrong sign** for non-symmetric distributions. Verified on χ²(k=2): post-fix skewness ≈ +2.0 (correct, positive); pre-fix was −2.0.

### T3.6 — kurtosis stencil catastrophically unstable at h=1e-4

The pre-fix routine used `h = 1e-4` for both the 2nd-derivative and 4th-derivative stencils. For the 4th derivative, `h⁴ = 1e-16 ≈ machine ε`, so the 5-point stencil's numerator (subject to catastrophic cancellation) was dominated by round-off noise.

**Fix**: use h sized for each derivative order — rule of thumb `h ~ ε^{1/(n+1)}`:
- 2nd derivative: h = 1e-4 (existing)
- 3rd derivative: h = 1e-3 (T3.6 widening)
- 4th derivative: h = 1e-2 (T3.6 widening)

Verified on χ²(k=2): post-fix excess kurtosis ≈ 5.99 vs expected 6.0; pre-fix was round-off noise.

### Verification — `test_l2_t3_5_6_fourier_cumulants.py`

4 new regression tests, all pass:
- `test_gaussian_zero_skew_kurtosis` — sanity: N(μ, σ) gives skew=0, ek=0.
- `test_skew_positive_and_correct` — χ²(k=2) skewness = +2 (T3.5 sign fix).
- `test_excess_kurtosis_stable` — χ²(k=2) ek = 6 (T3.6 wider h fix).
- `test_gamma_skew_sign` — Γ(k=3) skew = 2/√3 ≈ 1.155, ek = 2 (general check).

Full parallel suite: **12082 passed in 4:47** — zero regressions.

## v0.924.0 — 2026-06-12

**Fix L2 Tier-3 T3.4 / T3.7 — SINH grid endpoints + Clenshaw-Curtis weights for odd n.**

Two small numerical fixes in `numerical/_pde.py` and `numerical/_integrate.py`.

### T3.4 — SINH grid endpoints off when `concentration_point ≠ midpoint`

Pre-fix the Tavella-Randall SINH grid used a symmetric `xi = linspace(-3, 3)` and `alpha = 0.5 · (s_max − s_min) / sinh(3)`. The grid is `c + α · sinh(xi)`. When `concentration_point` was off-centre, the grid extended past `s_min` / `s_max` — for `c < midpoint` it went BELOW `s_min` and could go NEGATIVE when `s_min` was small (e.g. BS PDE with `s_min = 0.01 · spot`).

**Fix**: choose `α` from the larger half-distance `max(c − s_min, s_max − c) / sinh(3)`, then solve `xi_min = asinh((s_min − c)/α)` and `xi_max = asinh((s_max − c)/α)` so the grid endpoints are exactly `[s_min, s_max]` regardless of `c`.

### T3.7 — Clenshaw-Curtis weights wrong for odd n

The weight formula was hard-coded for even n. Two differences for odd n:
- Endpoint weight is `1/n²`, not `1/(n²−1)`.
- The loop's "halved k=n/2 boundary" term doesn't exist for odd n.

Pre-fix `∫₀¹ 1 dx` with n=3 returned ≈ 0.9 instead of 1; polynomial integration was correspondingly biased. Post-fix the routine branches on `n % 2`.

### Verification

- `test_l2_t3_4_sinh_grid.py` — 5 tests (midpoint exact; below-midpoint no negatives; above-midpoint endpoints; monotone; density concentrated near c).
- `test_l2_t3_7_clenshaw_curtis_odd_n.py` — 15 tests (constants integrate exactly for n=3,5,7,9,15; x², x³ exact; sin convergence monotone).

## v0.923.0 — 2026-06-12

**Fix L2 Tier-3 T3.8 / T3.9 / T3.10 — three small bugs in `numerical/_trees.py` convenience functions.**

Opens Tier-3 (single-critic criticals) by clearing three small but real bugs in `_trees.py`:

### T3.10 — `solve_tree` wrapper dropped `exercise_dates`

`solve_tree(...)` did not accept `exercise_dates`, so a caller passing `exercise=BERMUDAN` got a `TreeSolver` built with empty `exercise_dates`. `_should_exercise` returns False at every step for a Bermudan with no dates → option silently degraded to European. Added `exercise_dates: list[int] | None = None` parameter and threaded it through.

### T3.9 — `solve_tree_2d` American projection only handled `spread_call`

Pre-fix the American-exercise projection inside the backward loop had:

```python
if is_american:
    s1 = ...; s2 = ...
    if payoff is not None:
        new_v[i,j] = max(new_v[i,j], payoff(s1, s2))
    elif payoff_type == "spread_call":
        new_v[i,j] = max(new_v[i,j], max(s1-s2-strike, 0))
```

No branches for `spread_put`, `best_of_call`, `worst_of_call`. They silently priced as European even with `is_american=True`. Refactored intrinsic into a `_intrinsic_2d(s1, s2)` helper covering all payoff types. American spread-put now shows the expected early-exercise premium (e.g. 26.95 vs European 26.90 on a deep ITM spread).

### T3.8 — `solve_tree_2d` always returned zero Greeks

`return TreeResult(price=..., delta=0.0, gamma=0.0, theta=0.0, ...)` regardless of inputs. Now extracts `delta1` and `delta2` from the step-1 grid (4 nodes, averaging out the spot direction being differentiated). `delta1` lands in the conventional `delta` field; `delta2` goes in `node_prices` as a 2-element array `[delta1, delta2]` (no API extension needed). Gamma and theta remain at 0 — the 2-asset recombining tree has no centred node at (S1, S2) at step 1, so straight ∂V/∂t mixes spot-diffusion convexity with time decay. Bump-and-reprice is the correct way to get gamma/theta on a 2D tree.

### Verification — `test_l2_t3_trees_misc.py`

6 new regression tests, all pass:
- `test_bermudan_with_exercise_dates_dominates_european` — Bermudan put > European put (pre-fix they were equal).
- `test_bermudan_with_no_exercise_dates_equals_european` — sanity: empty exercise set ⇒ European.
- `test_spread_call_delta_nonzero` — delta1 > 0, delta2 < 0 for ATM spread call.
- `test_delta_sum_at_high_spread_approaches_one` — deep-ITM spread: delta1 ≈ +1, delta2 ≈ −1.
- `test_american_spread_put_premium` — American > European for ITM spread put.
- `test_american_worst_of_call_with_custom_payoff` — custom payoff: American ≥ European.

## v0.922.0 — 2026-06-12

**Fix L2 T2.15 — SABR-HW swaption blender returns intrinsic at T=0 instead of unconditional zero.  CLOSES ALL 18 TIER-2 BUGS.**

`options/swaption.py::price_swaption_sabr_hw` had:

```python
if T <= 0:
    return 0.0
```

This returned 0.0 even when the swaption had positive **intrinsic** value (e.g. a payer with strike below the current forward swap rate, evaluated at expiry).

**Fix**: at T ≤ 0 compute and return the intrinsic value:
- Payer: `annuity × max(fwd − K, 0) × notional`
- Receiver: `annuity × max(K − fwd, 0) × notional`

### Verification — `test_l2_t2_15_sabr_hw_blender_intrinsic.py`

4 new regression tests, all pass:
- `test_payer_at_expiry_returns_intrinsic` — deep-ITM payer at T=0 returns positive intrinsic, matches annuity × (fwd − K).
- `test_receiver_at_expiry_returns_intrinsic` — symmetric for receiver.
- `test_out_of_money_at_expiry_returns_zero` — OTM at T=0 still returns 0 (no negative intrinsic).
- `test_atm_post_expiry_positive_T_unchanged` — sanity: positive-T Black-76 path still works.

## v0.921.0 — 2026-06-12

**Fix L2 T2.14 — bond YTM-based pricing now uses the last-period notional for redemption (consistent with curve-based pricing).**

`fixed_income/bond.py::FixedRateBond` set `self.face_value = self.coupon_leg.notional` (the first-period notional from a possibly-variable notional schedule). The curve-based `dirty_price` already used `notional_schedule[-1]` for the redemption to support sinking-fund bonds. But three YTM-based methods used the first-period `self.face_value` for the principal term, causing a silent disagreement between YTM-pricing and curve-pricing for amortising bonds:

- `_price_from_ytm`
- `macaulay_duration`
- `convexity`

For a 5y semi-annual bond amortising 100 → 55, the pre-fix YTM price had a redemption term of 100 / (1 + y/2)^10 while the curve price had 55 × DF(5y). The two paths could disagree by tens of cents at par-equivalent levels.

**Fix**: all YTM-based paths use `self.coupon_leg.notional_schedule[-1]` consistently. Constant-notional bonds are unaffected (first = last). Lock-in test verifies curve-vs-YTM agreement on both constant-notional and amortising bonds.

Also covers T2.13 — `aad_curves` no-deposit first-swap case (subsumed by v0.911 T1.13 fix), with explicit regression test (`test_l2_t2_13_aad_first_swap_no_deposits.py`) committed earlier.

### Verification — `test_l2_t2_14_bond_sinking_redemption.py`

4 new regression tests, all pass:
- `test_constant_notional_ytm_matches_curve` — sanity: plain bond, YTM and curve agree.
- `test_amortising_redemption_matches_curve` — sinking-fund bond (notional 100→55): YTM and curve now agree (pre-fix had large discrepancy).
- `test_duration_uses_last_notional` / `test_convexity_uses_last_notional` — duration and convexity produce sane values for sinking-fund bond.

Full parallel suite: **12048 passed in 3:29** — zero regressions.

Tier-2 status: **16 of 18 closed** (T2.13, T2.14 added). Remaining: T2.15 (SABR-HW blender at T=0).

## v0.920.0 — 2026-06-12

**Fix L2 T2.11 / T2.12 — `g2pp_swaption_price` no longer silently masks errors as zero or falls back to bogus `y* = 0`.**

Two silent-failure modes in `models/g2pp_calibration.py::g2pp_swaption_price`:

### T2.11 — Bare `except Exception: return 0.0` around the entire body

The whole function was wrapped in `try: ... except Exception: return 0.0`, masking every error mode (bracketing failure, brentq divergence, numerical-overflow in the ZCB formula, calibration bugs) as a silent zero price. Callers had no way to distinguish "swaption worth ≈ 0" from "pricer crashed".

### T2.12 — Silent `y_star = 0.0` fallback on bracket failure

The Jamshidian y* bracketing routine had:

```python
if bp_lo * bp_hi >= 0:
    y_star = 0.0       # ← bogus fallback
else:
    y_star = brentq(...)
```

When bracketing failed (no sign change after 10 expansions), `y_star = 0.0` is just **wrong** — the K_k strikes derived from it are unrelated to the actual swaption. Combined with T2.11, this produced wildly wrong intermediate prices that the outer except then collapsed to zero.

### Fixes

- T2.11: removed the outer `try/except Exception: return 0.0`. Only the legitimate degenerate cases (no payment dates) still return 0.0 explicitly. Real exceptions propagate.
- T2.12: bracket failure now raises `RuntimeError` with a diagnostic message including the failing `x_val`, the bracket endpoints' bond-portfolio values, and a hint about parameter regime.

### Verification — `test_l2_t2_11_12_g2pp_silent_failures.py`

4 new regression tests, all pass:
- `test_normal_params_produce_positive_price` — sanity: reasonable G2++ params produce a positive finite price.
- `test_zero_payment_dates_returns_zero_cleanly` — degenerate tenor=0 still returns 0.0 explicitly (the only path that should).
- `test_negative_a_propagates_error` — extreme parameters don't silently give 0.0 (either succeed or raise).
- `test_extreme_params_either_raise_or_succeed` — across strike sweep, never silently produce 0; either valid price or RuntimeError with diagnostic.

Full parallel suite (with previously-deselected slow `test_g2pp_calibration` tests included): **12041 passed in 3:24 + 70s for G2++ calibration suite** — zero regressions. The removed silent except did not surface any hidden failures in the full G2++ calibration loop, which validates the fix.

Tier-2 status: **14 of 18 closed** (T2.11, T2.12 added).

## v0.919.0 — 2026-06-12

**Fix L2 T2.10 — `MCEngine.greek()` actually honours `param_name`.**

Pre-fix `models/mc_engine.py::MCEngine.greek()` accepted `param_name: str` as a *required* parameter but **never used it**. The implementation always did `self.process.x0 = original_x0 + bump`, which broadcasts the scalar bump across the whole `x0` vector. For a multi-factor process (Heston: x = [S, V]; G2++: x = [x, y]; basket models), "delta" simultaneously bumped every state variable, producing a meaningless mixed sensitivity.

**Fix**: `param_name` is now parsed into one of three forms:
- `int` — index into `process.x0` (e.g. `0` = spot, `1` = variance).
- `"x0"` or `"x0[i]"` — same as the int form.
- any other string — interpreted as an attribute of the `ProcessSpec` (e.g. `"sigma"`, `"mu"`). Requires the drift/diffusion callables to read the attribute at evaluation time. Lets the user compute vega-like sensitivities to model parameters.

Bounds-checked (`IndexError` for bad index, `ValueError` for unknown attribute). Restores the original `x0` / attribute cleanly on the way out.

### Verification — `test_l2_t2_10_mc_greek_param_name.py`

6 new regression tests, all pass:
- `test_x0_index_zero_only_bumps_spot` — 1D GBM `"x0[0]"` gives BS-plausible delta (0.4 < Δ < 0.85).
- `test_int_param_name_works` — bare integer index works.
- `test_x0_restored_after_greek` — restoration check.
- `test_attribute_bump_vega_via_sigma` — `param_name="sigma"` bumps the process's `sigma` attribute and recovers a BS-plausible vega (20 < vega < 60).
- `test_unknown_param_name_raises` — bad string raises `ValueError`.
- `test_index_out_of_range_raises` — bad index raises `IndexError`.

## v0.918.0 — 2026-06-12

**Fix L2 Tier-2: tree knock-in barriers (T2.8) + trinomial probability renormalisation (T2.9).**

Two coupled bugs in `numerical/_trees.py`.

### T2.8 — knock-in barriers silently priced as vanilla

`_apply_barrier` had:

```python
elif self.barrier_type == BarrierType.DOWN_IN:
    pass  # complex — for now, only knock-out supported
elif self.barrier_type == BarrierType.UP_IN:
    pass
```

So the barrier condition was checked but never enforced for in-types. `TreeSolver(barrier_type=BarrierType.DOWN_IN, ...).solve(...)` produced the **vanilla** price, with no warning. The TreeSolver API accepted the type and returned a wrong number.

**Fix**: at the top of `solve()`, intercept knock-in types and apply in-out parity:

> V_knock_in = V_vanilla − V_knock_out

Spawn two side-pricers (one with the corresponding knock-out type, one without barriers) and combine prices + Greeks by linearity. Live verification:

```
Vanilla   = 10.4406
DOWN_OUT  = 10.3523
DOWN_IN   = 0.0883     # post-fix; pre-fix was 10.4406 (= vanilla)
OUT + IN  = 10.4406    # exactly equals vanilla
```

### T2.9 — Trinomial probability triple not renormalised after clamp

`_trinomial_params` had:

```python
p_u = max(0, min(1, p_u))
p_d = max(0, min(1, p_d))
p_m = max(0, 1 - p_u - p_d)
```

When the raw `p_u` or `p_d` was negative (large drift relative to volatility), clamping shifted mass into `p_m` without renormalising the triple. The probs still summed to 1 but the *moments* (drift, variance) were broken — the risk-neutral measure silently violated.

**Fix**: clamp each leg ≥ 0, then renormalise the triple. Mirrors the renormalisation already used in `_2d_trinomial_params` (the 2D tree) immediately below in the same file.

### Verification — `test_l2_t2_8_9_trees_barriers_probs.py`

6 new regression tests:

- `test_in_out_parity_down` / `test_in_out_parity_up` — V(KI) + V(KO) = V(vanilla) exactly; pre-fix V(KI) = V(vanilla) trivially.
- `test_knock_in_greeks_linearity` — KI delta = vanilla delta − KO delta exactly.
- `test_probs_sum_to_one_high_drift` — extreme-drift case (r=20%, σ=10%, dt=0.01) → renormalised probs sum to 1.0 exactly.
- `test_probs_unchanged_normal_regime` — sanity: normal-drift case (the clamp doesn't trigger).
- `test_trinomial_pricing_stable_under_high_drift` — extreme-drift call still produces a finite positive price.

Full parallel suite: **12031 passed in 3:23** — zero regressions.

Tier-2 status: **11 of 18 closed** (T2.8, T2.9 added).

## v0.917.0 — 2026-06-12

**Fix L2 T2.6 — `_romberg` now uses a native Richardson extrapolation; scipy.integrate.romberg was removed in SciPy 1.15.**

`numerical/_integrate.py::_romberg` wrapped `scipy.integrate.romberg`, which was removed in SciPy 1.15. Every call to `integrate(..., method=IntegrationMethod.ROMBERG)` raised:

```
ImportError: cannot import name 'romberg' from 'scipy.integrate'
```

Replaced with a native Romberg-on-trapezoid implementation (incremental trapezoidal refinement + Richardson extrapolation of the table). Returns proper `IntegrationResult` with the error estimate and convergence flag. No more SciPy version pin needed.

### Verification — `test_l2_t2_6_romberg_native.py`

6 tests, all pass:
- Constant function: ∫₀¹ 5 dx = 5 (exact).
- ∫₀¹ x³ dx = 1/4 to 1e-10.
- ∫₀^π sin(x) dx = 2 to 1e-10.
- 5σ-truncated standard normal CDF ≈ 1 to 1e-6.
- ∫₀^{2π} cos(x) dx = 0 to 1e-8.
- Smoke test: no ImportError, `result.method == "romberg"`, `result.converged`.

Tier-2 status: **9 of 18 closed** (added T2.6).

## v0.916.0 — 2026-06-12

**Fix L2 T2.5 — `wavelet_transform` pads non-power-of-2 input.**

`numerical/_fourier.py::wavelet_transform` halves the signal at each level via `x[0::2]` and `x[1::2]`. For odd `len(x)`, these slices have different lengths and the addition raised:

```
ValueError: operands could not be broadcast together with shapes (4,) (3,)
```

The DWT (Haar / DB2) is well-defined only on power-of-2 inputs. Fix: pad to `max(next_power_of_2(n), 2**levels)` with zeros before decomposition; also raise on `n < 2`. Power-of-2 inputs are unaffected.

### Verification — `test_l2_t2_5_wavelet_padding.py`

17 tests (parametrised over n = 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 17, 100, 1000 for Haar and 3, 5, 11, 17, 31 for DB2), all pass. Includes:
- Arbitrary-length Haar/DB2 no longer crash.
- Power-of-2 still produces a length-n coefficient vector (unchanged).
- Length-2 exact-value sanity check.
- Length-1 raises with clear message.

Tier-2 status: **8 of 18 closed** (T2.5 added; T2.1, T2.2, T2.3, T2.4, T2.7, T2.16, T2.17, T2.18 already closed).

## v0.915.0 — 2026-06-12

**Fix L2 Tier-2: CDS variable-notional propagates through aged-CDS methods + convexity formula uses notional.**

Three coupled bugs in `credit/cds.py` closed in one slice.

### T2.18 — `protection_leg_pv` silently used `notional[0]` for list inputs without `schedule_dates`

If a caller passed `notional=[1M, 2M, 3M]` but omitted `schedule_dates`, the function fell through to `n = notional[0]` and scaled the entire protection leg by 1M — variable-notional CDS got priced as constant-1M. Now raises `ValueError` so the caller cannot accidentally lose the schedule.

### T2.17 — Variable notional silently dropped in aged-CDS methods

`CDS.__init__` set `self.notional = self.notional_schedule[0]` (scalar first-period) for convenient single-value access. But five methods then passed `notional=self.notional` (the scalar) when constructing a new aged/parallel `CDS`:

- `isda_upfront` — built the std-coupon CDS with scalar
- `roll_down` — built shorter CDS with scalar
- `theta` — built aged CDS with scalar
- `rec01` — built recovery-bumped CDS with scalar
- `cds_pnl_attribution` — built aged CDS with scalar

Result: variable-notional CDS got their tail-period notionals silently dropped in roll-down, theta, isda upfront, rec01, and full P&L attribution.

**Fix**:
- `rec01` and `isda_upfront`: forward `self.notional_schedule` (full list).
- `roll_down`, `theta`, `cds_pnl_attribution`: introduce new `_aged_notional(new_start)` helper that slices the schedule at the period containing `new_start`. The aged CDS then has a notional list of length = remaining-periods.

### T2.16 — Convexity P&L multiplied by `|PV|` instead of notional

`spread_convexity` returns `d²PV/ds² / notional`. The second-order P&L correction is therefore

> convexity_pnl = ½ × (conv × notional) × Δs²

Pre-fix the code used `pv_for_conv = abs(pv_t0)` with a fallback to `cds.notional` only when `|PV| < 1e-10`. This was dimensionally wrong: |PV| is small near par (where the CDS spread equals the par spread, e.g. typical IG trading conventions) and grows with mark-to-market away from par — neither is the right normalisation. The formula effectively collapsed to ~0 near par and gave a |PV|-scaled value elsewhere.

Fixed to `0.5 * conv * cds.notional * delta_spread**2`.

### Verification — `test_l2_t2_cds_variable_notional.py`

8 new regression tests, all pass:

- `TestProtectionLegRequiresScheduleForList`:
  - `test_raises_on_list_without_schedule` — variable notional without schedule_dates now raises.
  - `test_scalar_path_unchanged` — scalar path still works.
- `TestVariableNotionalPropagation` (amortising 5y CDS with 20 periods, notional from 10M → 2.4M):
  - `test_average_notional_not_scalar` — sanity: the schedule is genuinely variable.
  - `test_isda_upfront_uses_average_notional` — variable vs constant-10M produce different upfronts.
  - `test_roll_down_sees_variable_notional` — roll_down for variable ≠ for first-period-only.
  - `test_theta_sees_variable_notional` — same for theta.
- `TestConvexityFormula`:
  - `test_convexity_pnl_nonzero_at_par` — at-par CDS (|PV|≈0): post-fix convexity is non-zero (pre-fix collapsed to ~0).
  - `test_convexity_scales_with_notional` — 10× notional → 10× convexity P&L (linearity check).

Full parallel suite: **12002 passed in 4:50** — zero regressions.

## v0.914.0 — 2026-06-12

**Fix L2 Tier-2: PDE non-uniform stencil + Dirichlet BC + American boundary + time-index — 4 bugs in `PDESolver1D` closed in one slice.**

Opens the Tier-2 phase by clearing four entangled bugs in `numerical/_pde.py::PDESolver1D` that all touched the same `_theta_step` and outer time loop.

### T2.2 — Uniform-grid stencil applied to non-uniform grids

`_theta_step` discretised the second derivative with `d2 = σ²S² / (ds_m · ds_p)` and split it evenly into sub/super diagonals (`a[i] = d2/2 − d1`, `c[i] = d2/2 + d1`). For uniform grids this is correct; for non-uniform grids (LOG, SINH) the proper 3-point central stencil is

> V_{i-1} coef = σ²S² / (ds_m · (ds_m+ds_p))
> V_{i+1} coef = σ²S² / (ds_p · (ds_m+ds_p))
> V_{i}   coef = −σ²S² / (ds_m · ds_p)

Live measurement on the canonical ATM call (S=100, K=100, r=5%, σ=20%, T=1y):

| Grid | Pre-fix PDE | Black-Scholes | Pre-fix error |
|---|---|---|---|
| UNIFORM | 10.4645 | 10.4506 | +0.13 % |
| LOG | **11.7966** | 10.4506 | **+12.9 %** |

Post-fix:

| Grid | Post-fix PDE | rel. err |
|---|---|---|
| UNIFORM | 10.4645 | +0.13 % |
| LOG | 10.4734 | **+0.22 %** |

### T2.3 — Implicit Dirichlet BC not enforced in tridiagonal solve

The tridiagonal system was built with `diag[0]=1, lower[0]=upper[0]=0` and `rhs[0]=0` (zero-init), so `V_new[0] = 0` after the solve. The code then overwrote `V_new[0] = V[0]` (the value BEFORE the step). The interior equation at `i=1` therefore used `V_new[0]=0` inside the implicit solve — wrong for **puts** (whose lower BC is `K·e^{−rτ} − S[0]`, non-zero) and for the upper BC of calls.

Fix: pass the proper BCs into `_theta_step` as `bc_lo`, `bc_hi`; set `rhs[0]=bc_lo`, `rhs[-1]=bc_hi`. The boundary rows with `diag=1` then yield `V_new[boundary] = BC` naturally, and the interior solve at `i=1` / `i=N−2` uses the proper boundary value.

### T2.B — Time-to-maturity index inverted at the boundary

The outer loop applied the upper-boundary value as `S_max − K·exp(−r·(n_time − step)·dt)`. After step `k`, the time-to-maturity is `(k+1)·dt`, NOT `(n_time − k)·dt`. The expression is only correct at the middle step; everywhere else the boundary uses the wrong discount factor. Replaced with `τ = (step + 1)·dt`.

### T2.4 — American boundaries used European discounted strike

For American puts at `S→0`, the optimal exercise dominates: `V = K − S[0]` (intrinsic). Pre-fix the boundary used `K·e^{−rτ} − S[0]` (European). Fix: for `is_american=True`, set boundaries to intrinsic payoff, and re-impose intrinsic floor after the early-exercise projection.

### Verification — `test_l2_t2_pde_stencil_bc.py`

6 new regression tests, all pass:

- `TestNonUniformStencil::test_log_grid_atm_call_matches_bs` — the headline: LOG grid no longer overshoots BS by 13 %.
- `TestNonUniformStencil::test_uniform_grid_atm_call_matches_bs` — uniform grid unchanged (was already fine).
- `TestDirichletBC::test_uniform_grid_atm_put_matches_bs` — uniform put now matches BS (pre-fix the implicit BC bug biased puts).
- `TestDirichletBC::test_log_grid_atm_put_matches_bs` — combined fix: non-uniform grid + correct BC for put.
- `TestAmericanBoundary::test_american_put_dominates_european` — deep-ITM American put ≥ intrinsic ≥ European.
- `TestTimeIndex::test_long_dated_call_no_explosive_bias` — 5y ATM call agrees with BS to <2 %.

## v0.913.0 — 2026-06-12

**Fix L2 T1.1 — `multilevel_mc` Giles coupling: coarse path now uses paired-sum fine increments. CLOSES ALL 13 TIER-1 BUGS.**

The last of MODULE_HEALTH's Tier-1 (dual-critic-confirmed) bugs is closed.

### The bug

`numerical/_mc.py::multilevel_mc` claimed to implement Giles (2008) MLMC. The algorithm requires that at each level l ≥ 1, the FINE path (n_fine = base_steps · 2^l timesteps) and the COARSE path (n_fine / 2 timesteps) share the SAME underlying Brownian motion — the coarse path is obtained by **pairing** fine Brownian increments:

> dW_coarse[m] = dW_fine[2m] + dW_fine[2m+1]

This coupling is what makes Var(P_fine − P_coarse) → 0 as the discretization refines (the property MLMC's O(ε⁻²) cost depends on).

The pre-fix code instead generated the fine path then **downsampled** it:

```python
paths_fine = process_fn(n_paths, n_fine, seed_l)
paths_coarse = paths_fine[:, ::2]    # <-- the bug
```

Since the downsampled "coarse" path is just a sub-sampling of the fine path's *output*, for any European payoff depending only on the terminal value `paths[:, -1]`:

> P_fine = payoff(paths_fine[:, -1])
> P_coarse = payoff(paths_fine[:, ::2][:, -1]) = payoff(paths_fine[:, -1])
> P_fine − P_coarse ≡ 0

The MLMC correction at every level ≥ 1 was identically zero. `multilevel_mc` collapsed to E[P_0] — a 4-step Euler estimate — at any number of levels. The function returned a heavily biased estimate while quietly pretending to do MLMC.

### The fix — proper Giles coupling

Redesigned the `process_fn` interface to consume **pre-generated Brownian increments** instead of an opaque seed:

```python
process_fn: callable(dW, dt) → paths array (n_paths, n_steps+1)
```

The MLMC routine now does the coupling work:

```python
Z = rng.standard_normal((n_paths, n_fine))
dW_fine = Z * sqrt(dt_fine)
dW_coarse = dW_fine[:, 0::2] + dW_fine[:, 1::2]     # <-- pair the increments

paths_fine = process_fn(dW_fine, dt_fine)
paths_coarse = process_fn(dW_coarse, dt_coarse)     # SAME Brownian path, coarser stepping
```

This is a breaking API change to `process_fn`, but there were no production callers (only the smoke `assert callable(multilevel_mc)` test), and the previous routine was broken anyway.

### Verification — `test_l2_t1_1_mlmc_giles.py`

4 new regression tests, all pass:

- **`test_mlmc_converges_to_black_scholes`** — the headline test. ATM European call on GBM (S₀=100, K=100, r=5%, σ=20%, T=1y). 6-level MLMC with 20 000 base paths must agree with Black-Scholes to <5% relative. Pre-fix this returned the heavily biased 4-step Euler P₀ estimate.
- **`test_level_corrections_are_nonzero`** — proves Giles coupling actually decouples fine and coarse. With the SAME seed, a 1-level run and a 4-level run produce measurably DIFFERENT estimates. Pre-fix they were identical (corrections were all 0).
- **`test_paired_increments_have_same_terminal_brownian_value`** — sanity: `sum(dW_fine) == sum(dW_coarse)` (the terminal Brownian motion is preserved by pairing). Algebraic identity, kept as a regression anchor.
- **`test_variance_dominated_by_low_levels`** — Giles signature: per-level variance increments decay. The level-1 correction adds nonzero variance (proof of working coupling).

Full parallel suite: **11988 passed in 3:20** — zero regressions.

## v0.912.0 — 2026-06-12

**Fix L2 T1.4 — `interior_point` now honours equality constraints via SLSQP inner solve.**

Twelfth of 13 Tier-1 (dual-critic-confirmed) bugs closed. Only T1.1 (MLMC) remaining.

### The bug

`numerical/_optimize.py::interior_point` accepts `equality_constraints` as a parameter and even **constructs** the SciPy-style constraint dicts:

```python
constraints = []
if equality_constraints:
    for h in equality_constraints:
        constraints.append({"type": "eq", "fun": h})

r = _minimize(barrier_obj, x, method="BFGS",     # <— never passes `constraints`
              options={"maxiter": 50, "gtol": tol / t})
```

…but never passes the list to `_minimize`, and uses **BFGS** (an unconstrained method) for the inner solve. So any caller passing `equality_constraints` got them silently dropped — the optimiser just minimised the (barrier-modified) objective over the unconstrained space.

This is a critical bug: every caller using `interior_point` for an equality-constrained problem (e.g. minimum-norm projection, equality-constrained least-squares with logarithmic barriers) was getting the **unconstrained** minimum back.

### The fix

When equality constraints are present, switch to **SLSQP** (the SciPy method that supports equality constraints) and pass the constraint dicts. Pure-inequality problems keep the BFGS path (faster for unconstrained barrier subproblems):

```python
if constraints:
    r = _minimize(barrier_obj, x, method="SLSQP",
                  constraints=constraints,
                  options={"maxiter": 100, "ftol": tol / t})
else:
    r = _minimize(barrier_obj, x, method="BFGS",
                  options={"maxiter": 50, "gtol": tol / t})
```

Additional convergence-check fix: pure equality-constrained problems (no inequalities) used to never terminate the outer loop (the existing check `n_ineq / t < tol` required `n_ineq > 0`). Added a fast-path that breaks on `r.success` after the first SLSQP pass — no need to grow `t` when there are no barrier terms.

### Verification — `test_l2_t1_4_interior_point_equalities.py`

4 new regression tests, all pass:

- `test_simple_equality_constrained_quadratic` — minimise ‖x‖² in ℝ³ subject to `sum(x) = 3`. Optimum = (1, 1, 1). Pre-fix → (0, 0, 0) (unconstrained minimum, sum = 0 not 3).
- `test_two_equalities` — minimise ‖x‖² subject to `x₀+x₁=1` and `x₁+x₂=1`. Both equalities now hold to 1e-4.
- `test_equality_plus_inequality` — minimise `x²+y²` subject to `x+y=2` (eq) and `x≥0.5` (ineq). Optimum = (1, 1), value 2. Both equality AND inequality honoured simultaneously.
- `test_pure_inequality_path_unchanged` — regression check on the BFGS path when no equalities are supplied: unchanged behaviour, converges to the unconstrained optimum (1, 2) on a strict-interior problem.

## v0.911.0 — 2026-06-12

**Fix L2 T1.13 — AAD swap bootstrap properly interpolates intermediate-coupon DFs through the unknown last-pillar DF instead of silently flat-extrapolating.**

Eleventh of 13 Tier-1 (dual-critic-confirmed) bugs closed.

### The bug

`aad_bootstrap` (in `curves/aad_curves.py`) iterates over the input swaps and, at each step, builds a `temp_curve` from the EXISTING pillars only (i.e. the pillars determined so far — typically just the deposits before the first swap is processed). Intermediate-coupon DFs needed for the par-condition annuity were drawn via `temp_curve.df(coupon_date)`.

When the new swap's tenor extended beyond all existing pillars (the common case — bootstrap a 5y swap against a 1y deposit, the only thing existing at that point is the 1y deposit pillar), the intermediate coupons at 1.5y, 2y, 2.5y, ..., 4.5y fell **in the extrapolation region** of `aad_log_linear_interp`, which flat-extrapolates at `dfs[-1]` (the last known pillar's DF). So the bootstrap silently equated every gap-coupon DF to the deposit DF, biasing both:

1. **The numerical bootstrap itself** — the resulting 5y DF did not satisfy the par-zero PV condition when the curve was re-priced with proper interpolation.
2. **The AAD sensitivities** — d(df_mat)/d(swap_rate) propagated through wrong intermediate DFs.

### The fix

A fixed-point iteration where the trial curve at each step **includes** the current `df_mat` estimate as a pillar, so gap-coupon DFs interpolate between the last existing pillar and `df_mat`:

```python
df_mat = Number(brentq(_par_residual_float, 1e-6, 3.0))  # sharp float init
for _ in range(50):
    trial_dfs = pillar_dfs + [df_mat]
    trial_curve = AADDiscountCurve(reference_date, pillar_dates + [mat],
                                    trial_dfs, swap_dc)
    annuity_before_last = Number(0.0)
    for k in range(1, len(schedule) - 1):
        tau_k = year_fraction(schedule[k-1], schedule[k], swap_dc)
        annuity_before_last += par_rate * tau_k * trial_curve.df(schedule[k])
    tau_last = year_fraction(schedule[-2], schedule[-1], swap_dc)
    df_mat_new = (Number(1.0) - annuity_before_last) / (Number(1.0) + par_rate * tau_last)
    if abs(df_mat_new.value - df_mat.value) < 1e-14:
        df_mat = df_mat_new
        break
    df_mat = df_mat_new
```

Two-stage solver:

1. **Float pre-solve via `brentq`** — finds `df_mat` to machine precision using a plain-float `_FloatLogLinearCurve` that mirrors the AAD curve's log-linear interpolation. Sharp initial guess for stage 2.
2. **AAD fixed-point** — starting from the brentq solution, iterates the construction `x → (1 − annuity_before(x)) / (1 + K·τ_last)` with full Number arithmetic. At the converged fixed point, the AAD graph captures the implicit-function dependency `dx*/dp = −(∂A + ∂B) / (1 + ∂B/∂x)` of the par-condition root. Convergence is fast — `|B'(x*)|` is typically ≤ 0.06, so residual reaches 1e-14 in well under 50 iterations.

### Verification — `test_l2_t1_13_aad_bootstrap_interp.py`

4 new regression tests:

- **`test_bootstrap_repriceses_5y_swap_after_1y_deposit`** — the canonical T1.13 case. Bootstrap a 1y deposit + 5y swap, then re-price the 5y swap against the curve. Post-fix PV ≈ 5e-17 (machine precision). Pre-fix this re-pricing PV was far from zero because gap-coupon DFs were anchored at the deposit DF.
- **`test_bootstrap_repriceses_three_swaps`** — stress: 1y deposit + 2y, 5y, 10y swaps. All three must re-price at par. Post-fix: ≤ 1e-8 for each. Pre-fix: errors compound through the bootstrap chain.
- **`test_dpv_dswaprate_nonzero`** — AAD sensitivity check: `d df(3y) / d swap_5y_rate` and `d df(3y) / d dep_1y_rate` are both nonzero. Pre-fix the swap-rate adjoint was wrong because intermediate DFs didn't flow through `swap_rate`.
- **`test_bumped_swaprate_changes_intermediate_df`** — finite-difference check: a 1bp bump in the swap rate must move df(3y) by a measurable amount (>1e-5). Pre-fix the bumped curve's df(3y) was nearly identical to base because it was flat-extrapolated from the unchanged deposit DF.

Live demonstration of the fix:
```
Bootstrapped pillar DFs (post-fix):
  t=0.000 df=1.000000
  t=1.000 df=0.975279
  t=4.997 df=0.819202
Schedule DFs at 0.5y intervals:  smooth log-linear monotone interpolation
  t=1.496 df=0.954350  (between 1y and 5y pillars)
  ...
  t=4.499 df=0.837268
Re-priced par swap PV = -5.55e-17
```

## v0.910.0 — 2026-06-12

**Fix L2 T1.8 — COS method V_k payoff integral now intersects the payoff support with the truncation interval [a, b].**

Tenth of 13 Tier-1 (dual-critic-confirmed) bugs closed.

### The bug

The Fang-Oosterlee (2008) COS method prices a European option as

> price = K · e^{−rT} · Σ_k Re(φ(u_k) · e^{iu_k(x−a)}) · V_k

where V_k integrates the payoff against cosine basis functions over the truncation interval [a, b] for log-moneyness y = log(S/K). For a call payoff (e^y − 1)⁺, V_k integrates over y ∈ [max(0, a), b] (the payoff's support intersected with the truncation interval); for a put (1 − e^y)⁺, over [a, min(0, b)].

`models/cos_method.py` hardcoded the V_k bounds as `[0, b]` (call) and `[a, 0]` (put). This is correct in the typical regime where `a < 0 < b`, but is wrong in either of two regimes:

- **a > 0** (deep-ITM call, low vol, short T): the integration over `[0, b]` includes `[0, a]`, which is outside the truncation interval and should not contribute. Pre-fix the deep-ITM call mispriced.
- **b < 0** (deep-ITM put, low vol, short T): symmetric — `[a, 0]` includes `[b, 0]` outside the truncation.

### Verification of magnitude

Live demonstration — deep-ITM call S=200, K=100, r=5%, σ=8%, T=0.25 (here `a ≈ 0.41 > 0`):

| | Price |
|---|---|
| Black-Scholes reference | 101.242220 |
| COS post-fix (N=256, L=10) | 101.242220 |
| Relative error | 1.4e-16 (machine precision) |

Pre-fix this call mispriced because the V_k coefficients integrated over a domain that included a region outside the truncation, double-counting the call's payoff there.

### The fix

The patch is local to `cos_price`:

```python
if option_type == OptionType.CALL:
    c = max(0.0, a)
    d = b
    if c < d:
        V_k = 2.0/(b - a) * (_chi(k, a, b, c, d) - _psi(k, a, b, c, d))
    else:
        V_k = 0.0
else:
    c = a
    d = min(0.0, b)
    if c < d:
        V_k = 2.0/(b - a) * (-_chi(k, a, b, c, d) + _psi(k, a, b, c, d))
    else:
        V_k = 0.0
```

The `c < d` guard handles the pathological case where the truncation interval lies entirely outside the payoff's support (V_k = 0 — the option is unconditionally worthless within the truncation).

### Verification — `test_l2_t1_8_cos_method_truncation.py`

7 new regression tests (all pass):
- `test_atm_call_unchanged` / `test_atm_put_unchanged` — sanity: ATM (typical a < 0 < b regime) still agrees with Black-Scholes to 1e-4.
- `test_deep_itm_call_low_vol` — S=200, K=100, σ=8%, T=3m → a > 0 regime. Post-fix COS matches BS to <1e-3 (in practice machine precision).
- `test_deep_itm_put_low_vol` — S=50, K=100, σ=8%, T=3m → b < 0 regime. Same.
- `test_parity` (parametrised over ATM, deep-ITM call, deep-ITM put) — put-call parity holds across all three regimes. Pre-fix the deep-ITM regimes violated parity by the V_k bug.

## v0.909.0 — 2026-06-12

**Fix L2 T1.9 — Hull-White tree swaption now centres expiry-node rates on α(T_expiry), not on today's short rate r(0).**

Ninth of 13 Tier-1 (dual-critic-confirmed) bugs from `MODULE_HEALTH.md` closed.

### The bug

`HullWhite.tree_european_swaption` (in `models/hull_white.py`) built the trinomial tree to evolve state prices Q correctly to time `expiry_T`, then iterated over the expiry-time nodes with:

```python
r_j = r0 + j * dr
```

where `r0 = self._forward_rate(0.0)` — today's instantaneous short rate. That is wrong: under Hull-White, the rate at the expiry nodes is `r(T_expiry) = α(T_expiry) + j·dr`, where α is the closed-form drift adjustment

> α(t) = f^M(0,t) + (σ²/(2a²))·(1 − e^{−at})²

(Brigo-Mercurio 2006, eq. 3.34).

### Magnitude of the error

On a representative steeply rising curve (1% at t=0 rising 80bp/year, so 9% at 10y), with `a=0.05, σ=0.5%`:

| Quantity | Value |
|---|---|
| α(0)   | 1.20 % |
| α(3y)  | 7.41 % |
| Pre-fix centring | 1.20 % (used α(0)) |
| Post-fix centring | 7.41 % (uses α(T_expiry)) |
| **Centring error** | **621 bps in the short rate at expiry nodes** |

A 600bp error in the centring of the rate grid at expiry translates to a multi-tens-of-percent error in the swaption PV — far beyond any plausible model calibration tolerance.

### The fix

Two-line change in `hull_white.py`:

1. New method `HullWhite._alpha(t)` implementing the closed-form formula `α(t) = f(0,t) + (σ²/(2a²))·(1 − e^{−at})²`.
2. `tree_european_swaption` calls `alpha_expiry = self._alpha(expiry_T)` once before the node loop and uses `r_j = alpha_expiry + j * dr`.

The tree calibration in `_evolve_state_prices` is unchanged — only the readout step at expiry is corrected. (The closed-form α(t) is the continuous-time limit of the tree's per-step numerical calibration; for typical step sizes the two agree to within a few bp.)

### Verification — `test_l2_t1_9_hw_swaption_alpha.py`

5 new regression tests, all pass:

- `test_alpha_formula_at_zero_equals_short_rate` — sanity: α(0) = f(0,0) since `1−e^0 = 0`.
- `test_alpha_grows_with_forward_curve` — on a 100bp/year-slope curve, α(5y) − α(0) > 400bp (vs near-zero pre-fix when using α(0) everywhere).
- `test_tree_swaption_atm_matches_jamshidian_flat_curve` — on a flat 1% curve (where the pre-fix bug is small because α(T) ≈ α(0)), the tree price agrees with the analytical HW Jamshidian decomposition to within 5%.
- `test_tree_swaption_matches_jamshidian_steep_curve` — **the discriminating test**: 80bp/year-slope, 3y into 4y ATM payer. Post-fix the tree agrees with Jamshidian to within 10%; pre-fix the disagreement was >>10%.
- `test_tree_swaption_deep_itm_recovers_intrinsic` — deep-ITM with low vol → tree price within 15% of annuity·(fwd − K). Pre-fix the wrong centring biased this by the centring error × annuity, dwarfing intrinsic.

The test file embeds a self-contained Jamshidian-decomposition payer-swaption pricer (bracketing for r*, Brigo-Mercurio bond-option vol formula, ZBP via Black-style normal) as the ground-truth reference. ~120 lines including helpers.

## v0.908.0 — 2026-06-12

**Fix L2 T1.6 — discrete dividends now escrowed at the correct step in both binomial and trinomial trees.**

Eighth of 13 Tier-1 (dual-critic-confirmed) bugs from `MODULE_HEALTH.md` closed. This one had two sub-bugs in `numerical/_trees.py`:

### Sub-bug 1 — Binomial: dividends applied only to the terminal grid

Pre-fix, `_solve_binomial` constructed the spot tree by subtracting cumulative dividends *once at the terminal step*. The intermediate-step `S_step` array (used by every backward-induction iteration for early-exercise and barrier checks) was rebuilt as the **raw pre-dividend forward** at each step.

Consequence: an American option with a known dividend mid-life saw the wrong (too-high) intermediate spot, biasing the early-exercise decision; barrier knock-out checks used the wrong intermediate spot too. The terminal price was correct in aggregate, but the path-dependent / early-exercise behaviour was wrong.

### Sub-bug 2 — Trinomial: dividends silently ignored entirely

`_solve_trinomial` had **no dividend handling whatsoever** — `self.dividends` was accepted in the constructor but never read by the trinomial path. A user passing `dividends=[(25, 10.0)]` to `TreeMethod.TRINOMIAL` got identically the same answer as `dividends=None`.

### Fix — escrowed-dividend convention applied to both

Both `_solve_binomial` and `_solve_trinomial` now share the same per-step helper structure:

```python
def _cum_div_through(s: int) -> float:
    return sum(amt for step, amt in self.dividends.items() if step <= s)

def _spot_at_step(s: int) -> np.ndarray:
    grid = ...   # raw forward spot grid at step s
    cum = _cum_div_through(s)
    if cum > 0:
        grid = np.maximum(grid - cum, 0.01)
    return grid
```

At each step `s`, the spot grid has cumulative dividends paid through step `s` subtracted. This is the standard "escrowed dividend" convention (Hull §21.12): the underlying drops by the dividend amount on the ex-date, and that drop is reflected in *every* node from that step forward.

`S` (terminal) and `S_step` (intermediate) now both go through `_spot_at_step`, so they agree on the dividend-adjusted spot. Floor at `0.01` guards against degenerate cases where down-moves push the dividend-adjusted spot to zero.

### Verification — `test_l2_t1_6_discrete_dividends.py`

4 new regression tests, all pass:
- `test_dividend_at_step_zero_equals_terminal_dividend` — boundary: dividend at step 0 reduces call PV.
- `test_dividend_at_intermediate_step_affects_price` — dividend at step 25/50 reduces European call price.
- `test_american_call_with_dividend_exercises_correctly` — with a large mid-life dividend, American call ≥ European call (proper American premium for dividends — the classic textbook case).
- `test_trinomial_dividend_actually_affects_price` — trinomial now responds to `dividends=[(25, 10.0)]` (pre-fix delta was ~0; post-fix delta > 1).

## v0.907.0 — 2026-06-12

**Fix L2 Tier-1: four quick-win bugs (T1.2 trapz, T1.3 integrate_2d, T1.5 Tian, T1.7 Milstein).**

Opening the L2 audit by closing the four cheapest of MODULE_HEALTH's 13 Tier-1 (dual-critic-confirmed) bugs. Each was a small, surgical change with a regression test that locks in the fix.

### T1.2 — `numerical/_fourier.py` `CharacteristicFunction.density()` was a hard crash

`np.trapz` was removed in NumPy 2.x; the project's installed `numpy==2.4.3` lacks it. Every call to `density()` raised `AttributeError: module 'numpy' has no attribute 'trapz'`. Fix: rename to `np.trapezoid`. Function had no callers in production code so the bug was dormant; it now works for any future caller (verified: `density(N(0,1))` at `x=0` ≈ 0.3989).

### T1.3 — `numerical/_integrate.py` `integrate_2d` argument order was inverted

`scipy.integrate.dblquad` expects `func(y, x)` (y is the inner variable). The function was passing `f` directly. For symmetric integrands the bug was invisible; for non-symmetric ones the result was wrong: `integrate_2d(lambda x, y: x, (0,3), (0,1))` returned **1.5** instead of **4.5**. Fix: wrap with an explicit `_f_xy(y, x): return f(x, y)` before passing to scipy.

### T1.5 — `numerical/_trees.py` Tian binomial method had been silently running CRR

Two compounding errors in `_tian_params`:
1. `V = M² × (exp(σ²·dt) − 1)` (the *variance*) instead of `V = exp(σ²·dt)` (the *second-moment factor* — the actual Tian 1993 quantity).
2. The `u`/`d` formula was missing the `V` multiplier.

Combined effect: the discriminant `V² + 2V − 3` was nearly always **negative**, triggering the "very small dt × vol → fall back to CRR" guard. So calling `TreeMethod.TIAN` actually ran CRR for every call. Live demonstration (r=5%, σ=20%, dt=0.01):
- Standard Tian: disc = +0.0016, u/d are real.
- Pre-fix code: V = 0.0004, disc = −2.999, branch falls back to CRR.

Fix: match the published Tian (1993) JFQA derivation. The Tian method now produces u/d distinct from CRR, as it should.

### T1.7 — `models/mc_engine.py` Milstein scheme silently ran Euler (two sub-bugs)

```python
step_fn = euler_step if self.scheme == "euler" else euler_step   # COPY-PASTE
```

Even fixing the typo wasn't enough: `milstein_step_1d` requires `diffusion_deriv` (σ' for the correction term), but `ProcessSpec` had no field for it — the parameter at the call site stayed `None`, so Milstein reduced to Euler internally. Fix:
1. Replace the second `euler_step` with `milstein_step_1d`.
2. Add `diffusion_deriv: Callable | None = None` to `ProcessSpec.__init__`.
3. Plumb it through to the Milstein call.
4. When `scheme='milstein'` but `diffusion_deriv` is None, emit a `RuntimeWarning` and fall back to Euler (no longer silent).

Live: with GBM and σ=0.5, n_steps=10 over T=1y, Euler and Milstein now produce paths that differ visibly at the terminal — pre-fix they were identical.

### Verification

- 9 new regression tests in `test_l2_tier1_quick_wins.py`:
  - T1.2: density() runs; N(0,1) density at 0 ≈ 1/√(2π).
  - T1.3: non-symmetric integrand (4.5 not 1.5); symmetric unaffected; callable y_range uses x correctly.
  - T1.5: Tian parameters match Tian 1993 formulas; no longer equal to CRR for typical inputs.
  - T1.7: Milstein produces different paths from Euler when `diffusion_deriv` provided; warns when not provided.
- Full parallel suite: **11960 passed in 3:21** — zero regressions.

### Tier-1 status

**7 of 13 Tier-1 closed.** Remaining 6 are harder (deeper math review needed for T1.1 MLMC, T1.8 cos_method bounds, T1.9 Hull-White swaption analytic).

## v0.906.0 — 2026-06-11

**Fix L1 C.2 B1 — `curve_jacobian` resolves `pillar_tenors` to actual curve indices.**

Third HIGH-severity bug closed from L1 audit. Pre-fix, when a caller passed a custom `pillar_tenors` list (different from the curve's actual pillar grid), `curve_jacobian` silently bumped the WRONG pillars — the Jacobian's column labels were mismatched with the user's requested tenors.

### What was broken

```python
for j, pt in enumerate(pillar_tenors):
    bumped = curve.bumped_at(j, bump_size)   # ← j is an enumeration index
    ...                                        #   NOT a resolved curve pillar
```

`bumped_at(j, ...)` takes a **curve pillar index**. The function looped over the user's `pillar_tenors` and used the enumeration index `j` directly. For a curve with pillars `[0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10]` and user request `pillar_tenors=[1, 2, 5]`:
- `j=0` → bumped index 0 → the 0.25y pillar (user thought: 1y)
- `j=1` → bumped index 1 → the 0.5y pillar (user thought: 2y)
- `j=2` → bumped index 2 → the 1y pillar (user thought: 5y)

The Jacobian's column labels lied. A caller multiplying `J` by a market-quote-bump vector got systematically wrong sensitivities.

### Change

- `curves/curve_risk.py:curve_jacobian` — when `pillar_tenors` is supplied, resolve each tenor to its actual curve pillar index (nearest match within `pillar_tol`); raise `ValueError` if any tenor doesn't match a curve pillar. New `pillar_tol=1e-2` default accommodates the 365.25-vs-day-count drift on `DiscountCurve.flat` pillars (~0.003y).
- 5 new regression tests in `test_curve_jacobian_pillar_resolution.py`:
  - default `pillar_tenors=None` uses the curve's own grid.
  - custom `pillar_tenors=[1, 2, 5]` correctly bumps those pillars (J[0,0] dominant for 1y query).
  - unrecognised tenor raises clearly.
  - tolerance allows close matches (1y vs 1.00274y).
  - out-of-order tenors produce columns in the user-supplied order.
- Full parallel suite: **11951 passed in 3:40** — zero regressions.

## v0.905.0 — 2026-06-11

**Fix L1 curves audit A.2 B1 + A.3 B1 — `global_solver` rejects duplicate maturities; `multicurve_newton` PV_float now includes the first accrual period.**

Two HIGH-severity active bugs from L1 Pass A, fixed in one slice.

### What was broken

**A.3 B1 — `multicurve_newton` PV_float skipped the first period.** The projection-swap PV_float loop started at `j=1`, walking from the first pillar onward. But `_compute_annuity` walked from `reference_date`. So PV_float had `N−1` segments while annuity had `N`. For 2-pillar projection swaps the bias was ~50%; the solver oscillated and emitted `RuntimeWarning: multicurve_newton: did not converge after 50 iterations. Residual: 2.86e-03`. That warning has been polluting the test suite for the entire session. **It was the bug talking.**

**A.2 B1 — `global_solver` silently dropped constraints on duplicate maturities.** The residual vector was indexed by `pillar_idx[mat]`. Two instruments at the same maturity (e.g. a 1Y deposit + 1Y OIS swap — both standard market quotes!) would overwrite each other's residual. Newton converged to a curve that didn't reprice all inputs. Live repro: 1Y depo @5% + 1Y swap @4% → zero rate 3.96% (only the swap survived).

### Change

- `curves/multicurve_solver.py:159-176` — projection PV_float loop now walks `[reference_date, *dates_up_to]` to match `_compute_annuity`. The `multicurve_newton: did not converge` warning is gone from the test suite.
- `curves/global_solver.py:46-77` — `global_bootstrap` builds a `seen_maturities` set; raises `ValueError("Duplicate maturity ... already provided by ..., also requested as ...")` on collision. Each pillar can be constrained by at most one instrument.
- 2 new regression tests in `test_multicurve_first_period.py`: convergence within tolerance under `RuntimeWarning`-as-error; round-trip identity (each projection swap rate recoverable from the calibrated curves).
- 5 new regression tests in `test_global_solver_collision.py`: deposit-swap collision raises; duplicate-deposit raises; duplicate-swap raises; error message identifies the conflicting type; distinct maturities still work.

### Verification

- Full parallel suite: **11946 passed in 4:06** — zero regressions.
- Warnings count dropped from 63 to 55 (the 8 dropped were the recurring `multicurve_newton: did not converge`).

### L1 Pass A — status update

| Bug | Status |
|---|---|
| A.1 B1 — `bootstrap` HW convexity wrong | LATENT (no current caller exercises it; deferred until either a caller appears or we coordinate a single fix) |
| A.1 B2 — float-leg conventions no-op | docstring fix queued |
| **A.2 B1** — `global_solver` residual collision | ✅ this slice |
| **A.3 B1** — `multicurve` PV_float first-period | ✅ this slice |
| A.4 B1 — `ncurve_solver` BasisSwap annuity | queued |
| A.4 B2 — `ncurve_solver` OIS schedule | queued |

Both active HIGH bugs closed. The dormant HW-convexity bug remains queued — it requires a refactor (re-route `bootstrap()` to call `ir_futures.hw_convexity_adjustment`) but since no caller is hitting it today, it sits behind A.4 in priority.

## v0.904.0 — 2026-06-11

**Generic `to_dict` mutation-safety sweep — `vars(self)` → `dict(vars(self))` across L0.**

Closes a recurring footgun cluster surfaced by audit findings A.5 B1, A.7 B1, C.1 B1, and ~25 other instances of the same pattern in `book.py`, `daily_pnl.py`, `settlement.py`, `mandate.py`, `greeks.py`, `dependency_graph.py`, `convergence_framework.py`, `numerical_safety.py`, `numerical_method_map.py`, `market_data.py` (legacy), `trade.py` (orphan), `approximation.py`, `solvers.py`.

### What was broken

```python
@dataclass
class Result:
    x: float
    def to_dict(self) -> dict:
        return vars(self)   # ← returns self.__dict__ DIRECTLY, not a copy
```

Mutating the returned dict mutated the dataclass instance. Confirmed live in audit A.5 B1:
```
r = SolverResult(root=1.0, ...)
d = r.to_dict()
d['root'] = 999.0
# r.root is now 999.0
```

30 callsites had this pattern across `pricebook.core.*`.

### Change

- All 30 `return vars(self)` lines rewritten to `return dict(vars(self))` (defensive copy). Single regex sweep across 13 files; idempotent and behaviour-preserving for callers that don't mutate.
- Deleted the dead-code orphan `Trade.to_dict` at `core/trade.py:56-57` — it sat inside the `@dataclass` body but was overwritten at module-bottom by `_trade_to_dict` via `Trade.to_dict = _trade_to_dict`. Replaced with a one-line comment pointing to the real binding (closes audit C.1 B1).
- 9 new regression tests in `test_to_dict_mutation_safety.py` covering `SolverResult`, the 3 `approximation.py` dataclasses, `Greeks`, `Position` (book), `DailyPnL`, `CashSettlementResult`, `PortfolioHolding` (mandate). Each asserts that mutating the returned dict doesn't propagate to the source.
- Full parallel suite: **11930 passed in 3:28**. Zero regressions.

### L0 audit — closure

With this slice, **every confirmed bug from Pass A through Pass D of the L0 audit is now either fixed or queued as ARCH/LOW**.

| Severity | Count | Status |
|---|---:|---|
| HIGH | 5 | ✅ all fixed |
| MED | 6 | ✅ all fixed |
| LOW | many | mostly closed (`to_dict` sweep + Tokyo + ICMA test gaps + serialisation A.11 B3-B7 queued) |
| ARCH | 1 | B.3 C1 — legacy market_data deferred to Gate 2 design decision |

The pricebook L0 foundations are materially more correct than at the start of this session. ~25 commits, **11930 tests passing**, every fix landed with regression tests, legacy-debt ledger tracks every backwards-compat shim, audit chain (G1) wired end-to-end.

## v0.903.0 — 2026-06-11

**Fix C.7 B1 — settlement lag now interpreted as business days; calendar honoured.**

Closes the last MEDIUM-severity bug from L0 Pass C. `cash_settlement`, `cds_settlement_physical/_cash`, `option_settlement_cash/_physical`, and `futures_settlement_physical` all silently used **calendar** days for the T+N lag — a Friday trade settling T+2 landed on Sunday.

### Before / after

```
Friday 2025-08-01, cash_settlement T+2:
  BEFORE: 2025-08-03 Sun (calendar, non-business)
  AFTER:  2025-08-05 Tue (skip Sat+Sun)

Friday 2025-08-01, option_cash T+1:
  BEFORE: 2025-08-02 Sat
  AFTER:  2025-08-04 Mon

Thursday 2025-07-03, option_cash T+1 with US calendar:
  BEFORE: 2025-07-04 Fri (Independence Day — holiday)
  AFTER:  2025-07-07 Mon (skip July 4)
```

### Change

- Six settlement entry points (`cash_settlement`, `cds_settlement_physical`, `cds_settlement_cash`, `option_settlement_cash`, `option_settlement_physical`, `futures_settlement_physical`) now route through `add_business_days(d, lag, calendar)` instead of `date.fromordinal(d.toordinal() + lag)`.
- All six gain an optional `calendar` parameter. When `None`, only weekends are skipped (same as `Calendar.add_business_days(None)`). When provided, holidays are skipped too.
- Existing `test_settlement.py::test_settlement_lag` updated — the prior assertion `(settle - REF).days == 30` codified the calendar-day bug; replaced with exact business-day calculation (REF = Mon 2024-01-15; +30 BD → Mon 2024-02-26).
- 9 new tests in `test_settlement_business_days.py`: Friday + T+1/T+2/T+3/T+5 weekend skip across all four product types; July-4 Independence Day with US calendar; T+0 and mid-week sanity cases.
- Full parallel suite: **11930 passed in 3:25** — zero regressions.

### Affected upstream

Anything that imports settlement helpers from `pricebook.core.settlement` and reads `settlement_date`. Notable: FX spot dates (T+2), US equity option physical settlement (T+2), CDS cash settlement (T+5), bond futures physical delivery (T+3). The pre-fix dates would frequently land on weekends — useful as a "placeholder" date for sandbox demos but wrong for settlement-risk computations.

### Pass C — MEDs closed

| C.7 B1 | settlement lag business days | ✅ this slice |
| C.8 B1 | dollar_gamma formula | queued (LOW) |
| C.1 B1 | dead-code orphan to_dict | queued (LOW, generic to_dict sweep) |

## v0.902.0 — 2026-06-11

**Fix D.1 B1+B2+B3 — `PricingContext` round-trip preserves every field; `replace()` no longer aliases mutable dicts.**

Three pre-existing bugs in `PricingContext` (all carried over from the prior `MODULE_HEALTH.md` audit and verified at L0 audit Pass D.1) fixed in one focused slice.

### What was broken

1. **B1 — empty containers collapsed to `None` on round-trip.** `_ctx_from_dict` had `proj = {...} or None` patterns. An empty `projection_curves`/`vol_surfaces`/`credit_curves`/`fx_spots` dict became `None`, so `ctx.projection_curves["foo"]` raised `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable` instead of the documented `KeyError`.
2. **B2 — fields silently dropped.** `_ctx_to_dict` emitted only 5 fields out of 13. **Silently dropped**: `discount_curves` (multi-currency), `inflation_curves`, `repo_curves`, `reporting_currency`, `stochastic_credit_models`, `credit_vol_surfaces`, `credit_correlations`, AND `numerical_config` (just added in G1 P3 Slice 1!). Multi-currency contexts lost data on every save/load round-trip.
3. **B3 — `replace()` aliased mutable containers.** `ctx2 = ctx.replace(reporting_currency="EUR")` then `ctx2.discount_curves["BRL"] = curve` mutated `ctx.discount_curves` too. Broke the "Immutable snapshot" docstring contract.

### Change

- `pricing_context.py:replace()` — now goes through a `_pick_dict` helper that `dict(...)`-copies every mutable container before passing to the new context.
- `_ctx_to_dict` — emits **every** dataclass-declared field, including `discount_curves`, `inflation_curves`, `repo_curves`, `reporting_currency`, `stochastic_credit_models`, `credit_vol_surfaces`, `credit_correlations`, `numerical_config` (serialised via `dataclasses.asdict`).
- `_ctx_from_dict` — `_fd_dict` helper reconstructs each value via the global registry (handles both envelope-format and opaque values); empty dicts stay empty (no `or None` collapse); `NumericalConfig` reconstructed from its `asdict` form.
- 13 new tests in `test_pricing_context_round_trip.py`:
  - **D.1 B1**: default-context round-trip preserves dict-not-None for all 10 container fields; access raises `KeyError` not `TypeError`.
  - **D.1 B2**: `discount_curves`, `reporting_currency`, `repo_curves`, `fx_spots`, `credit_correlations`, `numerical_config` (both populated AND `None`) all round-trip exactly.
  - **D.1 B3**: `replace()` doesn't alias `discount_curves` / `fx_spots` / `credit_correlations`; values copy through but underlying dict is a different object.
- Full parallel suite: **11921 passed in 3:55** — zero regressions.

### Affected upstream

Multi-currency users (anyone with `discount_curves={"USD": ..., "EUR": ...}`), users persisting `PricingContext` to disk for replay, scenario engines that build derived contexts via `replace()` and concurrently mutate them. The pre-fix behaviour silently corrupted data; the fix lands without behaviour change on any single-currency in-memory workflow.

## v0.901.0 — 2026-06-11

**Fix A.2 B2 — `TokyoCalendar` *furikae kyūjitsu* (振替休日) substitute-day rule.**

Closes the last MEDIUM-severity calendar finding from L0 Pass A. Tokyo's fixed-date holidays falling on Sunday now correctly cascade to a substitute holiday on the next non-holiday day per Japan's Public Holiday Act §3.2.

### Before vs after

| Date | Holiday | Status BEFORE | Status AFTER |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2018-04-30 Mon | Showa Day Sun → substitute | not holiday ❌ | holiday ✓ |
| 2025-11-24 Mon | Labour Thanksgiving Sun → substitute | not holiday ❌ | holiday ✓ |
| 2026-05-06 Wed | Constitution Sun + Greenery + Children's cluster → substitute | not holiday ❌ | holiday ✓ |
| 2024-04-30 Tue | (no sub needed, Apr 29 was Mon) | business day ✓ | business day ✓ |

The Golden-Week cascade case is the interesting one: May 3 2026 (Constitution) is Sunday; May 4 (Greenery) and May 5 (Children's) are already holidays; the substitute walks all the way to **May 6 Wed**. The implementation handles this generically via a while-loop that walks forward until it finds a non-holiday day.

### Change

- `core/calendar.py:TokyoCalendar._compute_holidays` — refactored to:
  1. Build a `fixed` set of fixed-date holidays.
  2. Build a `monday_holidays` set of variable Monday holidays (Coming of Age, Marine Day, Respect for Aged, Sports Day — by construction never on Sunday).
  3. Second pass over `fixed`: any Sunday entry gets a substitute computed by walking forward until a non-holiday day is found.
- 5 new tests in `test_calendar.py::TestTokyoCalendarSubstitution`: Showa Day 2018, Labour Thanksgiving 2025, Golden-Week cluster 2026, no-substitute-when-weekday case, Monday-holiday smoke check.
- Full parallel suite: **11908 passed in 4:06**.

### A.2 — closed

All four substitution-rule findings from L0 audit A.2 are now fixed:

| Sub-finding | Locale | Status |
|---|---|---|
| A.2 B1a | London (UK 1971 Act) | ✅ |
| A.2 B1b | Sydney (AU Public Holidays Acts) | ✅ |
| A.2 B1c | Wellington (NZ Holidays Act 2003) | ✅ |
| A.2 B1d | Toronto (Canadian federal/provincial) | ✅ |
| **A.2 B2** | **Tokyo (Japanese Public Holiday Act §3.2)** | ✅ **this slice** |

JPY-rate calculations crossing 2018-04-30 (Showa Day substitute), 2019-05-06 (Reiwa transition), 2025-11-24, and 2026-05-06 are now correct.

## v0.900.0 — 2026-06-11

**Fix A.11 B1 + B2 — `_deserialise_atom` now dispatches `list[SomeSerialisable]`, `list[Enum]`, and polymorphic `Union[A, B, None]`.**

Two medium-severity audit findings, one root cause: `_deserialise_atom` had a narrow list of supported parameterised types. Anything outside the narrow path silently returned the raw value, breaking round-trips for polymorphic fields.

### Before / after

| Type hint | Pre-fix behaviour | Post-fix behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| `list[date]` | reconstructed ✓ | reconstructed ✓ |
| `list[SomeSerialisable]` | **raw list of dicts** ❌ | recursively dispatched via registry ✓ |
| `list[SomeConvention]` | raw list ❌ | dispatched via `inner.from_dict` ✓ |
| `list[Colour]` (Enum) | raw list of strings ❌ | mapped to Enum members ✓ |
| `Optional[T]` (`T \| None`) | unwrapped ✓ | unwrapped ✓ |
| `Union[A, B, None]` | **raw value** ❌ | if dict with `"type"` key → registry-dispatch; else raw ✓ |

### Live test of the fix

A `_Container` class with a `list[_Leaf]` field and a `Union[_Leaf, _Branch, None] underlying` field now round-trips cleanly: every leaf is reconstructed, the polymorphic underlying lands on the correct concrete type based on its `type` tag. Pre-fix, both would have returned raw dicts.

### Change

`pricebook.core.serialisable._deserialise_atom`:
- **Union dispatch** (A.11 B2): when stripping `NoneType` leaves ≥2 non-None args, check if `v` is a dict with `"type"` → registry-dispatch via `from_dict`. Otherwise return raw (same as before — primitives don't need dispatch).
- **list[T] dispatch** (A.11 B1):
  - `list[date]` — unchanged.
  - `list[Serialisable]` — recursively dispatches each element; supports both envelope-format (`"type"` key → `from_dict`) and flat-convention format (no `"type"` → `inner.from_dict`).
  - `list[Enum]` — maps each element through the Enum constructor.
- 10 new tests in `test_serialisable_polymorphic.py`: container round-trip with each list shape + polymorphic Union with type-tag, both branches, and the None case + 3 direct atom-dispatch tests.
- Full parallel suite: **11903 passed in 4:04**. Zero regressions.

### What's still uncovered (queued)

- `list[tuple[...]]`, `list[list[...]]`, nested generic types — still raw. Genuinely niche; no current call-site needs them.
- `Union[A, B]` (no None) with non-tagged values — still raw. Can't auto-resolve without a discriminator.
- A.11 B3 (`_register` silent no-op on re-import), A.11 B4 (numpy `.item()` duck-test ordering), A.11 B5 (CurrencyPair parse), A.11 B6 (bare `KeyError`), A.11 B7 (Enum int-from-string) — all LOW severity, queued.

## v0.899.0 — 2026-06-11

**Fix B.1 B2 — `make_payload`/`read_payload` helpers extend G1 P3 Slice 2's schema-version coverage to custom `to_dict` overrides; `DiscountCurve` no longer drops `interpolation` on round-trip.**

A medium-severity audit finding that turned out to have wide reach. G1 P3 Slice 2 added `schema_version` to `Serialisable.to_dict` and the two decorators, but **classes with hand-written `to_dict` overrides** (the curves, `Trade`, `Portfolio`, `PricingContext`, several option types) bypassed all of it. They wrote `{"type": ..., "params": ...}` directly. Schema versioning was silently absent from their on-disk payloads.

### What was broken

Two distinct gaps in one root cause:

1. **`DiscountCurve.to_dict` dropped `interpolation`.** A curve built with `MONOTONE_CUBIC` or `AKIMA` interpolation serialised, then deserialised, silently came back as `LOG_LINEAR` (the constructor default). Live repro from the audit confirmed this. Any persisted curve with a non-default interpolation method was silently misinterpreted on reload.
2. **Schema versioning didn't reach custom-to_dict classes.** Payloads from `DiscountCurve`, `SurvivalCurve`, `Trade`, `Portfolio`, `PricingContext` carried no version field. When a future v2 lands, there'd be no way to distinguish.

### Change

- New helpers in `pricebook.core.serialisable`:
  - `make_payload(instance, params)` — builds `{"type": ..., "params": ..., "schema_version": ...}` from a Serialisable instance + a params dict. Drop-in replacement for hand-rolled envelopes.
  - `read_payload(d, cls)` — inverse: validates schema_version against `cls._SERIAL_SCHEMA_VERSION` and returns the params dict. Replaces `p = d["params"]` in custom `from_dict` overrides.
- Migrated:
  - `core/discount_curve.py` — uses `make_payload`/`read_payload`. **Includes `interpolation` in the params dict; deserialiser defaults to `LOG_LINEAR` when absent (back-compat for pre-fix payloads).**
  - `core/survival_curve.py` — uses helpers (interpolation was already preserved; this slice adds schema_version coverage).
  - `core/trade.py` — `Trade` and `Portfolio` both migrated.
  - `core/pricing_context.py` — migrated, plus the `vars(self)` → `dict(vars(self))` fix (same mutation pattern as solvers/approximation, now closed).
- 13 new tests in `test_custom_to_dict_schema_version.py`:
  - **Parametrised round-trip across all 5 `InterpolationMethod` values** — catches the B.1 B2 interpolation-loss bug for every method.
  - Pre-fix payload (no `interpolation` key) defaults to LOG_LINEAR — back-compat.
  - schema_version present on every migrated class.
  - Future version rejected with the standard ValueError.
  - Pre-fix payload (no schema_version key) still deserialises as v1.
- Full parallel suite: **11893 passed in 4:01** — no regressions.

### What's still uncovered

The 43 file-count from the audit includes many option/credit classes (`options/asian_option.py`, `options/barrier_option.py`, `credit/cds.py`, etc.) that still hand-roll `{"type": ..., "params": ...}`. They are NOT migrated in this slice — that work belongs in their respective audit passes (Pass C / D etc.). Behaviour is unchanged for them; they currently emit no schema_version which by contract reads back as v1 — back-compat all the way down.

### Wider implication

`make_payload`/`read_payload` is now the canonical pattern for any class with a custom `to_dict`. New code should always go through it; existing code migrates as each module gets audited.

## v0.898.0 — 2026-06-11

**Fix B.1 B1 — `DiscountCurve.roll_down` anchors rolled DFs to the new reference date.**

The fifth HIGH-severity L0 audit bug, now closed. `roll_down(days)` was silently producing curves with wrong zero rates because it forgot to apply the no-arbitrage anchoring `P(new_ref, d) = P(0, d) / P(0, new_ref)`. On a flat 5% curve, rolldown P&L was over-stated by **+1.4 bp per day** of roll.

### Live before / after

```
Flat 5% curve, ref=2024-01-01.

BEFORE:
roll_down(1d)  → zero_rate(2025-01-01) = 5.0137%  (+1.37 bp error)
roll_down(30d) → zero_rate(2025-01-01) = 5.4231%  (compounded error)
                          (any rolldown attribution off this is structurally wrong)

AFTER:
roll_down(1d)   → zero_rate(2025-01-01) = 5.0000% exactly
roll_down(30d)  → zero_rate(2025-01-01) = 5.0000% exactly
roll_down(365d) → zero_rate(2026-01-01) = 5.0000% exactly
```

### Change

- `discount_curve.py:126-178` — `roll_down` now computes `disc_to_new_ref = self.df(new_ref)` once and divides each pillar DF by it. Raises `ValueError` with a clear message if `disc_to_new_ref <= 0` (pathological / extrapolated curve).
- The "all pillars in the past" fallback now **preserves** the original `day_count` and `interpolation` instead of silently dropping them via `DiscountCurve.flat(...)` (a separate footgun called out in the audit).
- 5 new tests in `TestRollDown`: 1-day / 30-day / 365-day flat-curve zero-rate preservation; no-arbitrage anchor identity `df_rolled(d) == df(d) / df(new_ref)`; day_count + interpolation preservation in the all-pillars-past fallback.
- Full parallel suite: **11880 passed in 4:57**. Zero regressions.

### Affected upstream

Anything that calls `DiscountCurve.roll_down`: rolldown P&L attribution, daily carry/roll analytics, scenario time-shifts. The old behaviour over-stated rolldown gain by ~1.4 bp per day for a 5% curve. Practitioners running daily roll/carry on USD/GBP/EUR books would see this in their P&L explain.

---

## v0.897.0 — 2026-06-11

**Fix A.1 B1 Slice 4 — `FixedRateBond` YTM analytics use ICMA-correct period counting; par-yield round-trip is exactly 100.**

The fourth and decisive slice of the ICMA fix. Coupons were fixed in Slice 3; this slice fixes the *discount-time* side. UST and other ICMA-convention bonds now satisfy the par-yield identity exactly.

### What was broken (after Slice 3)

`FixedLeg` was producing correct coupon amounts (2.0000 exact for par 5y UST) but `_price_from_ytm` was computing time-to-cashflow via `year_fraction(settle, payment_date, ACT_ACT_ICMA)` for *multi-period spans*. That call silently falls back to ACT/365F because the current `_act_act_icma` implementation only handles single-period accruals (per ICMA 251.1) and not multi-period spans (ICMA 251.2). The result: coupon amounts at 2.0000 each, but discount times at 0.4986, 1.0027, 1.4986, ... instead of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, .... Par-yield round-trip landed at 99.981367 instead of 100.

### Change

- New method `FixedRateBond._ytm_time_to(settle, target)` computes the ICMA-correct time-to-cashflow:
  - If `settle` coincides with a coupon date → `(target_index − settle_index) / coupons_per_year` exactly.
  - If `settle` is mid-period → stub fraction (days_to_next_coupon / period_days) + full periods.
  - For non-ICMA conventions → falls back to `year_fraction(settle, target, day_count)` (unchanged).
- Routed `_price_from_ytm`, `macaulay_duration`, `convexity`, and `accrual_schedule` through `_ytm_time_to`. `modified_duration` and `dv01_yield` derive from these — no further change needed.
- The two characterisation xfails turn green; their markers are removed. **Tolerance tightened from 1e-8 to 1e-10** to lock in the new exactness.
- Full parallel suite: **11875 passed in 4:57** — zero regressions.

### Verified end-to-end

```
Pre-fix:  par 5y UST round-trip = 99.999807, par 30y = 99.999489
Post-fix: par 5y UST round-trip = 100.000000, par 30y = 100.000000
```

### A.1 B1 status

| Slice | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Add `strict_icma` flag on `year_fraction` | ✅ |
| 2 | Characterise UST mispricing with xfail tests | ✅ |
| 3 | `FixedLeg` passes ICMA refs (correct coupon amounts) | ✅ |
| 4 | `_ytm_time_to` helper (correct discount times) | ✅ (this slice) |
| N | Final: flip default to `strict_icma=True` after auditing remaining callers | queued |

UST and all other ICMA-convention bonds (Bunds, Gilts, JGBs, sovereigns) now compute coupon amounts AND par-yield round-trips correctly at machine precision. The audit chain's highest-blast-radius bug is closed for the bond-pricing path.

---

## v0.896.0 — 2026-06-11

**Fix A.1 B1 Slice 3 — `FixedLeg` cashflows now compute correct ACT/ACT ICMA year-fractions; UST coupons land exactly at face × coupon ÷ frequency.**

The third slice of the staged ICMA fix delivers the *coupon-side* correctness. `FixedLeg`'s cashflow builder now passes `ref_start`, `ref_end`, and `frequency` to `year_fraction`, so every regular coupon period on a Treasury / Gilt / Bund / JGB schedule gets `year_frac = 1 / coupons_per_year` *exactly* — per ICMA Rule 251.1.

### Before vs after (par 5y UST at 4% coupon, face=100, semi-annual)

| Coupon | Period | days | year_frac BEFORE | year_frac AFTER | amount BEFORE | amount AFTER |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 02/15 → 08/15 | 182 | 0.498630 | **0.500000** | 1.994521 | **2.000000** |
| 2 | 08/15 → 02/15 | 184 | 0.504110 | **0.500000** | 2.016438 | **2.000000** |
| 3 | 02/15 → 08/15 | 181 | 0.495890 | **0.500000** | 1.983562 | **2.000000** |
| 4–10 | (alternating) | — | 0.4959 / 0.5041 | **0.500000** | 1.9836 / 2.0164 | **2.000000** |

### Change

- `fixed_leg.py:69-93` — compute `coupons_per_year = 12 // frequency.value` once; pass `ref_start=accrual_start, ref_end=accrual_end, frequency=coupons_per_year` to `year_fraction` for every coupon. The extra params are ignored by non-ICMA conventions, so the change is harmless for THIRTY_360 / ACT_360 / ACT_365F / etc.
- Two of the four characterisation xfails turn green (`test_every_regular_coupon_is_exactly_half_year`, `test_every_coupon_amount_is_exactly_two`) — their `xfail` markers are removed; they now assert the correct behaviour permanently.
- Full parallel suite: **11873 passed, 2 xfailed in 4:55** — zero regressions in any other ICMA-using test.

### What's NOT fixed yet (queued for Slice 4)

`FixedRateBond._price_from_ytm` (and the YTM-derived analytics: `macaulay_duration`, `modified_duration`, `convexity`, `dv01_yield`) use `year_fraction(settle, payment_date, ACT_ACT_ICMA)` for *multi-period* spans without passing refs — still hitting the legacy ACT/365F fallback. The current `_act_act_icma` implementation is correct for single-period accruals only; multi-period ICMA needs explicit period-counting per Rule 251.2.

The 2 remaining xfails (`test_par_yield_round_trip_is_exact_100`, 5y and 30y) are pinned for Slice 4. **Diagnostic note:** these tests xfail *worse* post-Slice-3 than they did pre-fix — the previous "99.999807" was the result of two errors partially cancelling. Now coupon amounts are correct but discount times still aren't, so the round-trip lands at 99.981367 (5y). Slice 4 will fix the discount-time path and turn these green.

### Affected upstream

Sovereign / corporate bonds using `DayCountConvention.ACT_ACT_ICMA` — all 11 markets currently wired (US, AU, MY, TH, SG, ID, HK, SE, CH, CZ, NO + linkers). Coupon amounts in those bonds now match market quotes within machine precision.

---

## v0.895.0 — 2026-06-11

**Fix A.1 B1 Slice 2 — UST ICMA mispricing characterised via xfail tests.**

Second slice of the staged ICMA fix. No source changes; the bug is now pinned to a reproducible test fixture with `xfail(strict=True)` markers so Slice 3 must turn them green (and CI catches partial fixes).

### Diagnostic — actual mispricing measured

A par-5y UST at 4% (face=100, semi-annual, issued 2024-02-15, matures 2029-02-15):

| Coupon | Period | days | year_frac (current) | year_frac (correct ICMA) | amount (current) | amount (correct) |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | Feb 15 → Aug 15 | 182 | 0.498630 | 0.500000 | 1.994521 | 2.000000 |
| 2 | Aug 15 → Feb 15 | 184 | 0.504110 | 0.500000 | 2.016438 | 2.000000 |
| 3 | Feb 15 → Aug 15 | 181 | 0.495890 | 0.500000 | 1.983562 | 2.000000 |
| 4–10 | (alternating) | — | 0.4959 / 0.5041 | 0.500000 | 1.9836 / 2.0164 | 2.000000 |

Par-yield round-trip: **99.999807** (should be exactly 100). These are the numbers from `MODULE_HEALTH.md` §`fixed_income/bond.py`, now nailed down in `test_treasury_icma_characterisation.py`.

### What the slice adds

- New test file `python/tests/test_treasury_icma_characterisation.py` (6 tests):
  - Smoke: bond's `day_count` is `ACT_ACT_ICMA`. PASSES today.
  - **xfail(strict=True)**: every regular coupon has `year_frac == 0.5` exactly.
  - **xfail(strict=True)**: every coupon amount is exactly `2.0`.
  - **xfail(strict=True)**: par-yield round-trip lands at exactly `100.0` (5y).
  - **xfail(strict=True)**: same for 30y (error accumulates across 60 coupons).
  - Diagnostic test that always passes — prints the actual current values for visibility in test logs (to be removed in Slice 3 once the fix lands).

Full parallel suite: **11871 passed + 4 xfailed in 4:55**.

### Why xfail and not skip

`xfail(strict=True)` enforces a contract: the test MUST fail today, MUST pass after the fix. If Slice 3 accidentally doesn't fix one of the cases, CI flips that case to "unexpected pass" and the slice fails. Skip would let a partial fix through silently.

### Next slice

**A.1 B1 Slice 3** — fix `FixedLeg` to pass `ref_start=accrual_start, ref_end=accrual_end, frequency=12/months_per_period` to `year_fraction`. Turn the four xfails green. Remove the diagnostic test.

---

## v0.894.0 — 2026-06-11

**Fix A.1 B1 Slice 1 — `strict_icma` flag on `year_fraction` (no behaviour change).**

First slice of the staged ICMA fix. Adds the machinery to detect and refuse silent fallbacks; default remains the legacy permissive behaviour so this slice changes nothing in production code paths. Subsequent slices will migrate one ICMA caller at a time, each verified by a hand-calc test (e.g. "par UST gives exactly 2.0000 per semi-annual coupon"), and only at the very end will the default flip to strict.

### What this slice adds

- `year_fraction(..., strict_icma: bool = False)` — keyword-only flag.
- `_act_act_icma(..., strict: bool = False)` — internal helper now raises `ValueError` (instead of silently degrading to ACT/365F) when `strict=True` AND any of:
  - `ref_start`, `ref_end`, or `frequency` is missing (closes A.1 B1 root cause when callers opt in).
  - `frequency <= 0` (closes A.1 B2 — pre-fix would `ZeroDivisionError`).
  - `period_days <= 0` (inverted ref dates).

Each `strict=True` failure produces a precise, actionable error message:
```
ACT/ACT ICMA requires coupon-period anchors. Missing: ref_start, ref_end, frequency.
Pass `ref_start`, `ref_end`, and `frequency` to `year_fraction(...)`.
```

### Test coverage

12 new tests in `test_day_count.py::TestACTACTICMA`:
- Par UST semi-annual exact half-year (regular 182-day period).
- Long-period invariance (184 days still gives 0.5 — that's the whole point of ACT/ACT ICMA).
- Mid-period accrual.
- Legacy fallback when refs are missing (back-compat invariant).
- Strict mode raises with clear messages on missing-refs / frequency=0 / inverted-period.
- Strict mode default-off preservation invariant.

Full parallel suite: **11869 passed in 4:50** — zero downstream behaviour change.

### Next slices (A.1 B1 roadmap)

| Slice | Scope |
|---|---|
| 1 (this one) | Add the flag. Default off. ✓ |
| 2 | Audit `FixedRateBond.treasury_note` — confirm UST mispricing per MODULE_HEALTH; add failing test. |
| 3 | Fix `treasury_note` to pass refs + switch its call-site to `strict_icma=True`. UST coupons land at exactly 2.0000. |
| 4..N | One slice per remaining ICMA caller in `pricebook/fixed_income/*.py` (~10 sovereign-bond modules). |
| Final | Flip the default to `strict_icma=True`, remove the flag. |

## v0.893.0 — 2026-06-11

**Fix A.2 B1b/c/d — `AUDCalendar`, `NZDCalendar`, `CADCalendar` Saturday substitution.**

Completes audit finding A.2 B1. London was already fixed in v0.892. AUD / NZD / CAD followed the identical pattern — base-class US-style `_observe` applied to non-US locales. Now all four use `Calendar._observe_next_working_day` (Sat → +2 days Mon; Sun → +1 day Mon).

### Citations

- **AU** — Australian Public Holidays Acts (state-by-state but uniform Sat→Mon rule).
- **NZ** — Holidays Act 2003, *"Mondayisation"* provision.
- **CA** — Holidays Act (federal) + Employment Standards Acts (provincial).

### Test coverage added

Each calendar gets a `TestXXXCalendarSubstitution` class with regression tests for the Sat-Christmas year (2021 and/or 2027) plus a locale-specific check that exercises a non-Christmas date falling on Saturday:

- AUD: Australia Day 2030 Sat → Mon Jan 28; Australia Day 2025 Sun → Mon Jan 27.
- NZD: Waitangi Day 2027 Sat → Mon Feb 8.
- CAD: Canada Day 2028 Sat → Mon Jul 3; Remembrance Day 2028 Sat → Mon Nov 13.

Full parallel suite: **11860 passed in 3:22**.

### A.2 B1 — closed

| Locale | Status | Slice |
|---|---|---|
| GBP / London | ✅ fixed | v0.892 |
| AUD / Sydney | ✅ fixed | v0.893 |
| NZD / Wellington | ✅ fixed | v0.893 |
| CAD / Toronto | ✅ fixed | v0.893 |

Next L0-audit-driven fix: **A.1 B1 — ACT/ACT ICMA silent fallback** (UST mispricing). Multi-slice plan in the audit doc.

---

## v0.892.0 — 2026-06-11

**Fix A.2 B1a — `LondonCalendar` Saturday substitution now follows UK Banking and Financial Dealings Act 1971.**

First of four per-calendar fixes for audit finding A.2 B1. London was producing wrong observed-holiday dates whenever a fixed-date bank holiday fell on a Saturday — recurring every ~6 years (2021, 2027, 2032, ...).

### What was broken

`Calendar._observe` is the US rule (5 U.S.C. § 6103): Saturday → previous Friday, Sunday → next Monday. London inherited that rule unchanged.

UK Banking and Financial Dealings Act 1971 specifies: any bank holiday on Saturday or Sunday is observed the **next working day** (typically Monday).

Live repro before the fix — Christmas 2021 (Dec 25 Saturday):
```
2021-12-24 Fri: was holiday=True  (wrong — should be a business day)
2021-12-27 Mon: was holiday=True  (right, by accident, because Boxing-Day-Sun lands here)
2021-12-28 Tue: was business=True (wrong — should be Boxing observed)
```

After the fix:
```
2021-12-24 Fri: business day ✓
2021-12-27 Mon: Christmas observed ✓
2021-12-28 Tue: Boxing Day observed ✓
```

### Change

- `calendar.py:93-101` — `Calendar._observe` docstring clarified as "US-style" with a cross-reference to the new helper.
- `calendar.py:103-128` (new) — `Calendar._observe_next_working_day` static helper implements the UK / AU / NZ / CA rule (Sat → +2 days, Sun → +1 day). Per-locale subclasses opt in via `_observe = staticmethod(Calendar._observe_next_working_day)`.
- `calendar.py:LondonCalendar` overrides `_observe` to the next-working-day rule. Existing Boxing/Christmas collision handling (when both land on the same observed Monday) is unaffected — that code already pushes Boxing to Tuesday when the collision happens.
- 6 new tests in `test_calendar.py::TestLondonCalendarSubstitution`: Christmas 2021/2024/2027, Boxing 2021, New Year's 2028 Sat case, New Year's 2023 Sun case.
- Full parallel suite: **11848 passed in 4:42** — no regressions.

### Affected upstream

Any GBP-rate calculation that crosses a Saturday-Christmas, Saturday-Boxing, or Saturday-New-Year window. Days affected per affected year: 4 (one Friday wrongly closed; one Tuesday wrongly open; mirror at New Year). Years materially affected in the GBP curve's lookback window: 2021, 2027 (already past for 2021; 2027 lookback materially affects long-dated forwards observed today).

### Remaining (queued)

Same fix shape applies to `AUDCalendar`, `NZDCalendar`, `CADCalendar` — each as its own slice (separate failure surfaces, easier rollback).

---

## v0.891.0 — 2026-06-11

**Fix A.12 B1 — serialisation auto-discovery via `pkgutil.walk_packages`.**

The hand-maintained import whitelist in `core.serialization._ensure_loaded` is gone. The registry is now populated by walking every submodule of `pricebook` on first use.

### What was broken

`_ensure_loaded` was a curated list of 24 imports. The audit found 53 files in the codebase using `@serialisable` / `@serialisable_convention` / `_register` — so **29 modules' types were silently absent from the registry**. The failure mode was: `from_dict({"type": "esg_bond_spec", ...})` → `ValueError("Unknown type 'esg_bond_spec'")` — but only when the specific missing type was deserialised, after deployment. Every new module with a serialisable type carried this maintenance trap.

### Change

- `serialization.py:30-65` — `_ensure_loaded` now uses `pkgutil.walk_packages(pricebook.__path__, prefix="pricebook.")` + `importlib.import_module`. Idempotent; one-shot tree walk on first call. Any import failure is recorded in `_failed_imports` (module name + exception class) rather than silenced — visible to the test suite for CI catch.
- Auto-discovery now registers **120 types** (vs ~50 with the old whitelist). The codebase has not changed; the registry just sees what was always there.
- 4 new tests in `test_serialization_autodiscovery.py`: zero-import-failures invariant, ≥100 types registered, every major subpackage represented, regression test that `EquityIndexSpec` (from `core.market_conventions`, not in the old whitelist) is now reachable.
- Full parallel suite: **11842 passed in 4:41**.

### Side discovery — new audit finding

Auto-discovery surfaces a pre-existing `_SERIAL_FIELDS` mismatch on `AmortisingBond` — the registered fields (`face_value`, `coupon_rate`, `n_periods`, `frequency`) don't match `__init__` parameters (`amortisation_type`, `coupon_rate`, `maturity_years`, `n_payments`, `notional`). The `_register` validator emits a `UserWarning` at startup. This bug was hidden before because `amortising_bond` wasn't in the old whitelist. **Logged as a new audit finding** — to be fixed in the upcoming `amortising_bond` audit pass.

---

## v0.890.0 — 2026-06-11

**Fix A.4 B1 — `schedule.generate_schedule` EOM convention now anchors on `start` per ISDA 2006 §4.10.**

The first fix landing from the L0 audit. Schedule generation now correctly interprets the EOM rule for *all* generation paths (front-stub backward AND back-stub forward), not just the forward path that happened to work by accident.

### What was broken

In the front-stub (backward) generation path, the EOM decision was made inside `_add_months(d, months, eom)` by checking whether the rolling date `d` was itself EOM. For backward generation, `d` starts as `end`, so EOM was effectively anchored to `end`. When `start` was EOM but `end` was not, interior coupon rolls landed mid-month — violating ISDA 2006 §4.10 ("if the period start date is the last day of February, the period end date is the last day of February").

Live repro before the fix:
```
generate_schedule(start=2024-01-31, end=2024-08-15, semi-annual, SHORT_FRONT, eom=True)
  → [2024-01-31, 2024-02-15, 2024-08-15]      ← Feb 15 wrong; should be Feb 29
generate_schedule(start=2024-01-31, end=2025-04-15, semi-annual, SHORT_FRONT, eom=True)
  → [2024-01-31, 2024-04-15, 2024-10-15, 2025-04-15]   ← interior rolls all mid-month
```

After the fix:
```
[2024-01-31, 2024-02-29, 2024-08-15]
[2024-01-31, 2024-04-30, 2024-10-31, 2025-04-15]
```

### Change

- `schedule.py:25-30` — `_add_months(d, months, eom)` renamed to `_add_months(d, months, snap_to_eom)`. The boolean now means "globally snap to EOM" (a schedule-level decision), not "snap iff this particular d is EOM". The intent is documented inline.
- `schedule.py:80` — `generate_schedule` computes `snap_to_eom = eom and start == _end_of_month(start)` exactly once before both generation paths, and passes the same flag through.
- 3 new regression tests in `test_schedule.py`: ISDA §4.10 front-stub case + multi-year cross-leap-year case + start-not-EOM no-op case.
- Full parallel suite: **11838 passed in 3:20** — zero regressions in any downstream caller.

### Affected upstream

Any bond, swap, or amortising trade whose schedule had `start = EOM` and `end != EOM`. UST issued at end-of-month with a coupon-date maturity is the prototypical case. Schedules with EOM at *both* ends (the existing `test_eom_preserved` case) were already correct; nothing breaks.

---

## v0.889.0 — 2026-06-11

**G1 P3 Slice 2 — schema versioning on `@serialisable`. G1 P3 complete. Gate 1 closed.**

Every serialised dict now carries an explicit schema version, giving us a hard hook for future wire-format migrations without breaking anything that exists today. Combined with G1 P1 (`CalibrationResult`), G1 P2 (`MarketSnapshot` on every calibrator), and G1 P3 Slice 1 (`NumericalConfig`), pricebook is now **audit-ready**: a price is reconstructible from a stable, dated, versioned artefact graph.

- New class attribute `_SERIAL_SCHEMA_VERSION: int = 1` on `Serialisable`, `@serialisable`, and `@serialisable_convention`. Bump in your class when you make a *breaking* wire change.
- Envelope format (`Serialisable`, `@serialisable`) gains a top-level `"schema_version"` key alongside `"type"` and `"params"`.
- Flat-convention format (`@serialisable_convention`) gains a reserved `"_schema_version"` key — underscore-prefixed so it cannot collide with any real convention field.
- `from_dict` reads the version, treats *absent* as v1 silently (existing payloads on disk continue to deserialise), and raises a clear `ValueError("...schema_version=N, but this build only supports up to M. Upgrade this environment.")` when a payload was written by a newer build.
- Decorators take an optional `schema_version=N` keyword for classes that introduce migrations: `@serialisable("irs", [...], schema_version=2)` and `@serialisable_convention("foo", schema_version=3)`.
- 24 new tests in `test_serialisable_schema_version.py`: default version, to_dict emits version (envelope + flat), round-trip across all three paths, backward compat with absent-version payloads, future-version rejection with a clear message, wire-format key invariants, and version-key strip-before-construct.
- Full parallel suite: **11835 passed in 5:34** — every existing serialisation round-trip in the library still works.

### Gate 1 closed

Phase 1: every calibrator produces a uniform `CalibrationResult` (UUID, timestamp, code version, residuals, optimiser story).
Phase 2: every calibrator accepts a `MarketSnapshot`; id links to the result.
Phase 3: numerical hyperparameters become first-class on `PricingContext`; wire format becomes version-aware.

**Result:** a price computed today can be reconstructed tomorrow from a single, structured, versioned artefact chain: trade → pricer → `PricingContext{numerical_config, curves}` → `CalibrationResult.market_snapshot_id` → `MarketSnapshot`. Each link is dated, identified, and serialisable.

Next: Gate 2 — *production-grade*. Begin auditing each module with the audit chain available.

---

## v0.888.0 — 2026-06-11

**G1 P3 Slice 1 — `NumericalConfig` + `PricingContext.numerical_config`.**

Numerical hyperparameters become first-class. Two valuations on the same book with different MC path counts are *different valuations* — until now that choice was buried in hard-coded defaults inside each pricer and invisible to any audit. After this slice the choice lives on the context and can be serialised, diffed, and overridden as a single object.

- New module `pricebook.core.numerical_config`:
  - `NumericalConfig` — frozen dataclass with 14 fields covering Monte Carlo (paths, seed, antithetic, Sobol, Brownian bridge), PDE/FD (time/space steps, truncation width), tree steps, integration (tol, max-iter), COS method (N, L), root-finding (tol, max-iter), plus an `extra: Mapping[str, Any]` escape hatch. `.replace(**kwargs)` for ergonomic edits.
  - `DEFAULT_NUMERICAL_CONFIG` — frozen, shared singleton matching the historical library defaults so no existing behaviour changes.
- `PricingContext` gains `numerical_config: NumericalConfig | None = None`. `get_numerical_config()` returns the attached config or the default singleton — pricers should read through the accessor. `.replace(numerical_config=...)` works including clearing to `None`.
- 14 new tests in `test_numerical_config.py`: frozen-ness, `.replace`, default fallback, accessor returns attached / falls back, `simple()` factory unchanged, end-to-end with curve + config.
- Purely additive — `PricingContext.simple()` and all existing call-sites are untouched.

Next slice (G1 P3 Slice 2) adds **schema versioning** on `@serialisable` — closes Gate 1.

---

## v0.887.0 — 2026-06-11

**G1 P2 Slice 5 — jump-model calibrators accept a `MarketSnapshot`. G1 P2 complete.**

The last family of calibrators wires through. **Every calibrator in pricebook now accepts an optional `market_snapshot`**, and `CalibrationResult.market_snapshot_id` is populated whenever provided — closing Phase 2 of Gate 1.

- `pricebook.models.jump_calibration.calibrate_jump_model(...)` — keyword-only `market_snapshot: MarketSnapshot | None = None`. Covers all six Lévy / jump models (Merton, VG, Kou, NIG, CGMY, Bates).
- `calibrate_jump_surface(...)` — same; a single snapshot stamps onto every per-expiry result (the typical case: one observation set underlies the whole surface).
- `TYPE_CHECKING` import — no runtime dep.
- 6 new tests in `test_jump_snapshot.py`: keyword-only enforcement, id linkage on the single-expiry path, surface-level propagation across multiple expiries (each per-expiry `CalibrationResult.id` is distinct while the `market_snapshot_id` is shared).

### G1 P2 — complete (Slices 1-5)

12 calibration entry points across 9 modules now accept a `MarketSnapshot`:

| Slice | Module | Entry points |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `pricebook.market_data` | (types only) |
| 2 | `pricebook.curves.bootstrap` / `global_solver` | `bootstrap`, `global_bootstrap` |
| 3 | `pricebook.curves.multicurve_solver` / `credit.bond_hazard_bootstrap` | `multicurve_newton`, `bootstrap_hazard_from_bonds`, `bootstrap_hazard_mixed`, `bootstrap_hazard_adaptive` |
| 4 | `pricebook.models.{hw,g2pp,lmm}_calibration` / `pricebook.options.sabr` | `calibrate_hull_white`, `calibrate_g2pp`, `calibrate_lmm_vols`, `sabr_calibrate` |
| 5 | `pricebook.models.jump_calibration` | `calibrate_jump_model`, `calibrate_jump_surface` |

Audit chain end-to-end: **price → calibration → market snapshot**. Next: **G1 P3** — `NumericalConfig` on `PricingContext` + schema versioning on `@serialisable` — closes Gate 1.

---

## v0.886.0 — 2026-06-11

**G1 P2 Slice 4 — HW, G2++, SABR, LMM calibrators accept a `MarketSnapshot`.**

Four model calibrators wired in one slice. Audit chain now reaches every IR/vol model-calibration entry point in the library.

- `pricebook.models.hw_calibration.calibrate_hull_white(...)` — keyword-only `market_snapshot: MarketSnapshot | None = None`.
- `pricebook.models.g2pp_calibration.calibrate_g2pp(...)` — same.
- `pricebook.models.lmm_calibration.calibrate_lmm_vols(...)` — same.
- `pricebook.options.sabr.sabr_calibrate(...)` — same; returned dict's `"calibration_result"` carries the linked id.
- All four use `TYPE_CHECKING` import on `pricebook.market_data.MarketSnapshot` — no runtime dep added.
- 12 new tests in `test_models_snapshot.py`: keyword-only enforcement and id linkage on each calibrator (G2++ uses `method="minimize"` to stay under a second per test).

Single slice left in G1 P2: jump-model calibrators (`calibrate_jump_model` family: Merton, VG, Kou, NIG, CGMY, Bates) — same additive pattern. After that, G1 P2 closes and G1 P3 (`NumericalConfig` on `PricingContext`) begins.

---

## v0.885.0 — 2026-06-11

**G1 P2 Slice 3 — `multicurve_newton` + the bond-hazard bootstrap family accept a `MarketSnapshot`.**

Phase 2 of Gate 1 now reaches every major curve-and-hazard calibration entry point. The audit chain **price → calibration → market snapshot** is wired through the `curves` *and* `credit` subpackages — together with G1 P2 Slice 2, this covers all single- and multi-curve bootstrapping plus credit hazard calibration.

- `pricebook.curves.multicurve_solver.multicurve_newton(...)` gains keyword-only `market_snapshot: MarketSnapshot | None = None`. Id propagates through both converged and non-converged paths (the latter still emits the existing `RuntimeWarning`). Both `ois_curve.calibration_result` and `projection_curve.calibration_result` share the same `CalibrationResult` instance, so the link is canonical, not duplicated.
- `pricebook.credit.bond_hazard_bootstrap`:
  - `bootstrap_hazard_from_bonds(...)` — keyword-only `market_snapshot`. Id threads through `_bootstrap_sequential` and `_bootstrap_global` (both reach `CalibrationResult.market_snapshot_id`).
  - `bootstrap_hazard_mixed(...)` — same.
  - `bootstrap_hazard_adaptive(...)` — same; passes the snapshot through to the chosen downstream entry point.
- `TYPE_CHECKING` import on both new touch sites — no runtime dep on `pricebook.market_data`.
- 9 new tests in `test_multicurve_snapshot.py`: keyword-only enforcement, id linkage on converged + non-converged multicurve, id linkage on sequential + global bond-hazard, snapshot-presence is numerically inert.

G1 P2 ready for Slice 4 (other model calibrators: HW, G2++, SABR, LMM, jump models — same additive pattern).

---

## v0.884.0 — 2026-06-11

**G1 P2 Slice 2 — `bootstrap` and `global_bootstrap` accept a `MarketSnapshot`; snapshot id propagates onto the `CalibrationResult`.**

Audit chain extends: **price → calibration → market snapshot** is now wired end-to-end for the two L2 entry points used by every downstream pricer.

- `pricebook.curves.bootstrap.bootstrap(...)` gains a keyword-only `market_snapshot: MarketSnapshot | None = None` parameter.
- `pricebook.curves.global_solver.global_bootstrap(...)` gains the same keyword-only parameter.
- When provided, `MarketSnapshot.id` is stamped onto `CalibrationResult.market_snapshot_id` on the curve's `calibration_result`. When absent, the field stays `None` (back-compat).
- Snapshot is a **provenance pointer** in this slice — deposits/swaps args remain authoritative for the actual rates. A future slice will let bootstrap *derive* the deposit/swap lists from the snapshot's quotes.
- 9 new tests in `test_curve_bootstrap_snapshot.py`: snapshot↔calibration linkage, keyword-only enforcement, snapshot-presence is numerically inert, distinct snapshots produce distinct results.
- `TYPE_CHECKING` import on both files — no runtime dep added to `pricebook.curves`.

---

## v0.883.0 — 2026-06-11

**G1 P2 Slice 1 — `pricebook.market_data` package + canonical L1 raw-data types.**

Phase 2 of Gate 1 begins. Where Phase 1 made every calibration produce a `CalibrationResult`, Phase 2 makes the *raw market data* a first-class, identifiable artefact — so the audit chain extends one step further: price → calibration → market snapshot.

This first slice introduces the **types only**, purely additive — nothing existing is touched.

- New package `pricebook.market_data` (L1 in the layer graph; zero dependencies on other pricebook subpackages).
- `QuoteKind` — `str`-Enum of 17 recognised quote types (deposits, FRAs, futures, swaps, basis, xccy, CDS, bond px/yield, vol points, swaption/capfloor vols, FX spot/forward, inflation YoY/ZC, other).
- `QuoteId` — frozen dataclass `(kind, tenor, currency, label)`; stable, hashable, the "same instrument across time" key.
- `Quote` — frozen `(id, value, bid_ask_bp)`; a single observation.
- `MarketSnapshot` — frozen `(id: UUID, as_of: datetime, quotes: tuple[Quote,...], label)`. `MarketSnapshot.new()` auto-generates id + timestamp. `get(qid)`, `filter(kind=, currency=, label=)`, `with_quote(q)` (returns a new snapshot with a fresh id — replaces same-id quotes). `__len__`, `__iter__`, `__contains__` for ergonomic use.
- `FixingHistory` — frozen wrapper around `{(rate_name, date) -> value}`; `get`, `for_rate`, `rate_names`, `with_fixing`. Distinct from `MarketSnapshot` (fixings are backward-looking, no bid-ask).
- 31 new tests in `test_market_data_types.py` covering frozen-ness, equality, hashing, factory behaviour, auditing invariants (fresh id on `with_quote`, original snapshot unchanged).

The existing `pricebook.core.market_data.MarketDataSnapshot` is untouched — backward compatibility is total. Subsequent slices in G1 P2 will let bootstrap/global-bootstrap accept a `MarketSnapshot` and record `MarketSnapshot.id` on the resulting `CalibrationResult.market_snapshot_id`.

---

## v0.882.0 — 2026-06-11

**G1 P1 Slice 6 — `jump_calibration` produces `CalibrationResult`. G1 P1 complete.**

The last of seven calibration families lands. With this slice, **every calibration in the codebase produces a uniform `CalibrationResult` artefact**, closing out Phase 1 of Gate 1 in the `DESIGN.md` roadmap.

- `JumpCalibrationResult` (covers all six jump/Lévy models: Merton, VG, Kou, NIG, CGMY, Bates) gains `calibration_result: CalibrationResult | None` + `to_calibration_result()` method. `to_dict` gets `calibration_id` key.
- `calibrate_jump_model` populates with `model_class=f"jump_{model_type}"` (e.g. `jump_merton`, `jump_vg`, `jump_kou`, `jump_nig`, `jump_cgmy`, `jump_bates`), parameters as the per-model param dict (4 for Merton, 3 for VG, 4 for Kou, 4 for NIG, 4 for CGMY, 7 for Bates), residuals = `model_vol − market_vol` per strike, algorithm `"differential_evolution+L-BFGS-B"`, deterministic seed recorded, spot / rate / T / div_yield / bounds in `optimiser.extra`, `rmse_vol` in diagnostics, quotes named `smile_K=<strike>`.
- 12 new tests in `test_calibration_result_jump.py`: 9 end-to-end (1 fast Merton calibration with 3 strikes / `maxiter=30`) + 3 back-compat.
- 32 tests pass across the jump family (test_jump_calibration + test_jump_cross_validation + new file) — no regression.

### G1 P1 — complete (Slices 1-6)

103 dedicated calibration-layer tests in total. **Every calibrator in pricebook now produces a `CalibrationResult`:**

| # | Family | Model class string | Algorithm |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | foundation | (none — types only) | n/a |
| 2 | bond hazard | `bond_hazard_pwc` | brentq-per-bond / L-BFGS-B[+tikhonov] |
| 3 | Hull-White | `hull_white` | Nelder-Mead / DE / L-BFGS-B |
| 3 | G2++ | `g2pp` | differential_evolution+L-BFGS-B |
| 4 | LMM | `lmm` | iterative_scaling |
| 4 | SABR | `sabr` | nelder_mead |
| 5 | curve bootstrap | `discount_curve_bootstrap` | brentq-sequential |
| 5 | global curve | `discount_curve_global` | newton-global |
| 5 | multicurve | `multicurve` | newton-multicurve |
| 6 | jump (6 models) | `jump_{merton,vg,kou,nig,cgmy,bates}` | differential_evolution+L-BFGS-B |

The audit trail `(price) -> (calibration_id) -> (market_snapshot, code_version, optimiser)` is now reconstructable end-to-end for every calibrated number in pricebook.

Next phase: **G1 P2** — `MarketSnapshot` at L1, the canonical raw-market-data type. Curves will be built from snapshots; the `market_snapshot_id` field on `CalibrationResult` (currently always `None`) will be populated.

---

## v0.881.0 — 2026-06-11

**G1 P1 Slice 5 — curve bootstrap produces `CalibrationResult`.**

The highest-fan-out calibration in the codebase: nearly every pricing call traces back to a bootstrapped discount curve. Six of seven calibration families now carry the canonical artefact (bond hazard, Hull-White, G2++, LMM, SABR, **curve bootstrap**); jump calibration is the last one (Slice 6).

- **`DiscountCurve.calibration_result: CalibrationResult | None`** — new instance attribute on the L0 curve class itself. Defaults to `None` for curves built directly (`flat(...)`, manual pillar construction); set to the canonical artefact by bootstrap entry points. Type hinted under `TYPE_CHECKING` to avoid a runtime import cycle between `core` and `calibration`.
- **`curves.bootstrap.bootstrap()`** — sequential brentq-per-pillar bootstrap now constructs a `CalibrationResult` after the round-trip verification step and attaches it to the returned curve. `model_class="discount_curve_bootstrap"`, algorithm `"brentq-sequential"`, residuals = (model_rate − market_rate) per instrument (deposits, FRAs, futures) or (PV_fixed − PV_float) per swap, parameters keyed by pillar date as `df(YYYY-MM-DD)`. RMS residual ~1e-14 (machine precision, exact fit by construction).
- **`curves.global_solver.global_bootstrap()`** — Newton-global simultaneous solve. Residuals are the final per-instrument repricing errors; algorithm `"newton-global"`, `tol` and `max_iter` passed through to `OptimiserSpec`. Converged flag captures whether the Newton loop hit `tol` before `max_iter`.
- **`curves.multicurve_solver.multicurve_newton()`** — joint OIS + projection calibration. Both `MultiCurveResult.calibration_result` AND `ois_curve.calibration_result` AND `projection_curve.calibration_result` get the SAME `CalibrationResult` instance (they share the calibration). Parameters carry an `ois_df(...)` / `proj_df(...)` prefix to distinguish the two pillar sets. `MultiCurveResult` gains a `to_calibration_result()` method that returns the stored instance or builds on-demand.
- 17 new tests in `test_calibration_result_curve_bootstrap.py`: default-None on `DiscountCurve.flat`, populated by `bootstrap()` / `global_bootstrap()` / `multicurve_newton()`, residual sanity (machine precision for sequential, sub-tol for Newton), parameter naming, quote naming, unique-id-per-call, multicurve cross-attachment, back-compat for hand-constructed `MultiCurveResult`.
- 40 tests pass across the full curve family (bootstrap + global_solver + multicurve_solver + new Slice 5 tests) — no regression.
- `coupled_bootstrap` and `bootstrap_forward_curve` not migrated in this slice — deferred to Slice 5b if needed.

Next: Slice 6 covers `jump_calibration` — the last calibration family.

---

## v0.880.0 — 2026-06-11

**G1 P1 Slice 4 — LMM + SABR calibration produce `CalibrationResult`.**

Five of seven calibration families now produce the canonical artefact (bond hazard, Hull-White, G2++, LMM, SABR). Two remaining: curve bootstrap (Slice 5) and jump calibration (Slice 6).

- `LMMCalibrationResult` (dataclass) gains `calibration_result: CalibrationResult | None` field + `to_calibration_result()` method. `to_dict` gets `calibration_id` key.
- `calibrate_lmm_vols` populates with `model_class="lmm"`, parameters as `{"sigma_0", ..., "sigma_{n-1}"}` (one per forward rate), residuals in vol units (`fitted - target` per swaption), algorithm `"iterative_scaling"`, `correlation_beta` and `tau` recorded in `optimiser.extra`, `rmse_vol` in diagnostics.
- `sabr.sabr_calibrate` (dict-returning, by convention) gains a `"calibration_result"` key in its returned dict — additive, no existing key removed or renamed.
- SABR `CalibrationResult` has `model_class="sabr"`, parameters `{"alpha", "beta", "rho", "nu"}` (4 params), residuals as `model_vol − market_vol` per strike (vol units, not bp), algorithm `"nelder_mead"`, `forward` / `T` / `beta_fixed` in `optimiser.extra`, quotes named `smile_K=<strike>`. `calibrate_sabr_smile` inherits the dict unchanged.
- 21 new tests in `test_calibration_result_lmm_sabr.py`: 9 LMM end-to-end + 3 LMM back-compat + 9 SABR end-to-end (existing keys preserved, parameters / residuals / quotes / unique ids).
- 64 tests pass across LMM + SABR family (test_sabr.py + test_lmm.py + test_lmm_calibration.py + new file) — no regression.

Next: Slice 5 migrates curve bootstrap (`curves.bootstrap`, `curves.multicurve_solver`, `curves.global_solver`) to produce `CalibrationResult`. The curve bootstrap is the highest-fan-out calibration in the codebase — many tests will see the new field downstream.

---

## v0.879.0 — 2026-06-11

**G1 P1 Slice 3 — `g2pp_calibration` and `hw_calibration` produce `CalibrationResult`.**

Same template as Slice 2, applied to the two single-curve rate-model calibrations. Three of the seven calibration families in `pricebook` now produce the canonical artefact (bond hazard, Hull-White, G2++); LMM, SABR, jump, and curve bootstrap follow in Slices 4-6.

- `HWCalibrationResult` gains `calibration_result: CalibrationResult | None` field and a `to_calibration_result()` method that returns the stored instance when populated or builds on-demand otherwise. `to_dict` gets the `calibration_id` key.
- `calibrate_hull_white` populates `calibration_result` with `model_class="hull_white"`, parameters `{"a": ..., "sigma": ...}`, residuals in vol-bp, `OptimiserSpec(algorithm=...)` capturing the chosen optimiser (`Nelder-Mead`, `differential_evolution`, or `L-BFGS-B`), `rmse_vol` in diagnostics, and `n_steps` in optimiser.extra.
- `G2PPCalibrationResult` gains the same field and method. `to_dict` gets the `calibration_id` key.
- `calibrate_g2pp` populates with `model_class="g2pp"`, parameters `{"a", "b", "sigma1", "sigma2", "rho"}` (5 params), residuals in vol-bp, algorithm `"differential_evolution+L-BFGS-B"` (or `"L-BFGS-B"` for minimise method), and the parameter bounds in `optimiser.extra`. Seed=42 recorded when DE is used.
- 16 new tests in `test_calibration_result_g2pp_hw.py`:
  - 9 HW tests run the full `calibrate_hull_white` on a small 3-swaption grid (~3 sec each): population of all fields, optimiser name and extras, residuals match `per_swaption_errors`, rmse_vol in diagnostics, named quote IDs, `to_calibration_result()` returns stored instance, unique id per run, `calibration_id` in `to_dict`.
  - 7 G2++ tests via hand-constructed `G2PPCalibrationResult` (the slow full `calibrate_g2pp` is covered by existing tests in `test_g2pp_calibration.py` which are deselected in CI): on-demand `to_calibration_result()` path, parameters count (5), `calibration_id` in `to_dict` both populated and unpopulated paths.
- Zero behavior change to existing tests (24 HW + Slice 3 tests pass; existing G2++ tests untouched).

Next: Slice 4 migrates `lmm_calibration` and `sabr` calibration to the same pattern.

---

## v0.878.0 — 2026-06-11

**G1 P1 Slice 2 — `bond_hazard_bootstrap` now produces a `CalibrationResult`.**

First migration of an existing calibration to the new canonical artefact (DESIGN.md §6 G1 P1). The bond-hazard bootstrap was chosen because it is the most recently touched calibration (Tikhonov + L-curve work landed yesterday) and its results carry the richest provenance (`lam`, `roughness`, per-bond residuals).

- `HazardBootstrapResult` gains a `calibration_result: CalibrationResult | None` field. Defaults to `None` for backward compatibility with hand-constructed instances; entry points always populate it.
- `_bootstrap_sequential` populates a `CalibrationResult` with `model_class="bond_hazard_pwc"`, `objective=SSE`, `optimiser=OptimiserSpec(algorithm="brentq-per-bond", ...)`, one iteration per bond, per-bond weights.
- `_bootstrap_global` populates with `objective=WEIGHTED_SSE`, `optimiser=OptimiserSpec(algorithm="L-BFGS-B[+tikhonov(lam=...)]", ...)`. When `lam > 0`: `lam` recorded in `optimiser.extra`, `roughness` in `diagnostics.extra`. Algorithm name gets the `+tikhonov(lam=...)` suffix for quick filtering in audit logs.
- `bootstrap_hazard_mixed` (FRN + bond joint fit) also migrated; `quotes_fitted` carries `["bond_0", ..., "frn_0", ...]`.
- New `to_calibration_result()` method returns the stored instance when populated, or builds one on-demand from the existing fields when not. Latter path covers any legacy hand-construction.
- `to_dict()` gets a `calibration_id` key (the UUID stringified, or `None`). Lets persistence layers later use this as a foreign key.
- 15 new tests in `test_bond_hazard_calibration_result.py` — population, parameter/residual/weight matching, Tikhonov-extras, unique id per invocation, on-demand build, hand-construction back-compat, `calibration_id` in dict.

Zero existing test changes: the `rmse_bp`, `pillar_hazards`, and other historical API surface is preserved. The new `calibration_result` is purely additive.

Next: Slice 3 migrates `g2pp_calibration` and `hw_calibration` to produce `CalibrationResult` (same template).

---

## v0.877.0 — 2026-06-11

**G1 P1 Slice 1 — `pricebook.calibration` skeleton + `CalibrationResult` + `Calibrator` Protocol.**

First slice of Gate 1 from `DESIGN.md` §6. The calibration layer gets its own package; the canonical result type is defined here so that subsequent slices can migrate each existing calibrator family (bond hazard, G2++, Hull-White, LMM, SABR, curve bootstrap, multicurve) to produce a uniform `CalibrationResult`.

- New package `python/pricebook/calibration/`:
  - `__init__.py` — public exports.
  - `_types.py` — `CalibrationResult` (frozen dataclass with `id`, `timestamp`, `code_version`, `model_class`, `parameters`, `residuals`, `rms_residual`, `max_residual`, `optimiser`, `iterations`, `converged`, `diagnostics`, `market_snapshot_id`), `OptimiserSpec`, `CalibrationDiagnostics`, `ObjectiveKind` (SSE / weighted-SSE / RMSE / max-error / L1 / Huber), `Calibrator` Protocol.
  - `CalibrationResult.new(...)` factory — keyword-only, auto-generates `id` and `timestamp`, derives `rms_residual` and `max_residual` from `residuals`, reads `pricebook.__version__` for `code_version` by default.
- 22 tests in `tests/test_calibration_types.py` covering enum values, OptimiserSpec construction & frozen-ness, diagnostics defaults & population, factory derivation of RMSE/max-error, default weights, explicit weights, code_version detection & override, market_snapshot_id placeholder, frozen-ness at all levels, Protocol satisfaction.
- Zero internal pricebook imports (other than `pricebook.__version__` read defensively) — package sits cleanly in the dependency graph; no behavior change to any existing code.

This slice is purely additive: no existing module is touched. Slice 2 migrates `bond_hazard_bootstrap` to return the new result type with a thin compatibility wrapper preserving the existing `HazardBootstrapResult` interface.

---

## v0.876.0 — 2026-06-11

**`DESIGN.md` — §6 roadmap rewritten as Gate × Phase hybrid.**

- Old roadmap had 4 phases with significant overlap (CalibrationResult in P1, calibration layer in P2 — same effort, separate commits) and blurry themes ("foundational types" + "structural relocation"). Phase 2 was 20-27 slices bundling six different efforts.
- New structure: **5 gates** (each a user-visible promise) × **10 phases** (each one architectural focus):
  - **G1 Audit-ready** — P1 Calibration unified + P2 Market data L1 + P3 NumericalConfig & versioning (14-16 slices, 1-3 weeks). Prerequisite for the bottom-up audit.
  - **G2 Production-grade** — P4 Scenarios & failures + P5 Repositories & per-layer tests (7-9 slices).
  - **G3 Architecturally clean** — P6 small cleanups + P7 Risk relocation L3→L7 isolated (9-13 slices). P7 is the biggest single refactor; isolated so it doesn't poison its gate.
  - **G4 Capability-complete** — P8 AAD as protocol + P9 Payoff algebra (10-13 slices).
  - **G5 Performant at scale** — P10 C++ port (19-28 slices, open-ended).
  - Total: **59-79 slices, 7-19 weeks** at the historical pricebook slice rate.
- Each gate is shippable independently. G2 doesn't require G3; you can stop after G2 and have a meaningfully better library.
- Section now includes a per-gate exit criteria, a dependency graph between phases, and "the first three slices of G1 P1" so the immediate next step after acceptance is unambiguous.
- Executive summary + TOC updated to reflect the new structure.

## v0.875.0 — 2026-06-11

**`DESIGN.md` — theoretical design document (~30 pages).**

- New `DESIGN.md` at the repo root: a first-principles design of a financial analytics engine, then pricebook overlaid as the lens.
- Sections 1-3 (principles, reference architecture, patterns/anti-patterns) drafted by `app-designer` for an independent second perspective on architecture; sections 4-6 written here.
- The reference design: 9-layer architecture with **calibration as its own layer (L6)**, parallel to risk, both depending on pricing (L5). **Models as `Protocol`, not inheritance.** **Trades as frozen dataclasses, market state passed in via `PricingContext`**. AAD via generic-scalar discipline at L0. Industry references woven through (QuantLib, ORE, OpenGamma Strata, Numerix). Concrete proposed shapes for `PricingContext`, `CalibrationResult`, `RiskRun`, `Scenario`.
- Pricebook gap analysis (§4): the architecture matches the reference at the foundations (acyclic layering, `PricingContext` exists, serialisation contract, mostly-Protocol models, mostly-frozen dataclasses), but diverges in three structural places: **risk at L3 instead of L6 above pricing** (the biggest mismatch — forces risk modules to know about concrete instruments); **calibration distributed rather than its own layer** (no unified `CalibrationResult`); **market data conflated with curves** (cannot distinguish quotes from fits in the dependency graph).
- Delta list (§5): 6 high-value adds (CalibrationResult, MarketSnapshot, Scenario protocol, PricingFailure, NumericalConfig, schema versioning), 5 wrong-shape refactors (risk relocation, calibration consolidation, market data split, pe/ relocation, registry consolidation), 4 nice-to-haves, 5 explicit won't-fixes.
- Roadmap (§6): 4 phases, **~63-84 slices total, ~10-22 weeks at the historical slice rate**. Phase 1 (foundational types) is the prerequisite for the bottom-up audit (the next major task after this document is accepted).

Status: ready for pushback before the bottom-up audit begins. Sections 1-3 are load-bearing — everything in 4-6 depends on the layer cut and the calibration placement.

---

## v0.874.0 — 2026-06-11

**Hazard-from-bonds notebook — adapted to use the library Tikhonov.**

- Removed the ad-hoc `regularised_bootstrap(...)` function from the notebook builder (Section 5). Replaced its 5 call sites (λ-sweep, L-curve dense grid, LOO-CV inner loop, MC sensitivity, realistic demo) with `bootstrap_hazard_from_bonds(method="global", pillar_times=..., lam=...)`. Section 9's `res_tik` is now a `HazardBootstrapResult`, with downstream code reading attributes (`res_tik.pillar_hazards`, `res_tik.survival_curve`) instead of dict keys.
- Updated Section 5 prose to point users at the library API; replaced the closing cheat sheet's "not currently in library" caveat with the recommended call (`lam="auto"`, `pillar_times=[...]`).
- Notebook re-executes cleanly: 46 cells (down from 47 — one builder-cell removed), 0 errors, 14 embedded plots. Every headline number unchanged (L-curve λ* = 3.16e+06, LOO-CV λ* = 6.58e+06, Section-10 Q(5y) MC mean 0.8867 vs deterministic 0.8877) — the library-backed and ad-hoc fits agree to numerics.
- The notebook is now self-consistent with the library: a reader who sees the API in §5 can apply it directly in their own code with no further translation.

Closes the Tikhonov work started in v0.872. Two-slice pattern (library first, notebook after) preserved.

## v0.873.0 — 2026-06-11

**`pillar_times` override in `bond_hazard_bootstrap`.**

- `_bootstrap_global`, `bootstrap_hazard_from_bonds`, and `find_lcurve_lambda` all gain an optional `pillar_times: list[float] | None = None` parameter. When provided, it overrides the default even-spacing of pillars and `n_pillars` is ignored.
- Two common patterns this enables:
  - **Pillars at bond maturities** (exactly-determined fit at `lam=0`, regularised as `lam` grows) — useful when the bond universe has natural calibration anchors at the cashflow dates.
  - **Pillars at calendar benchmarks** (e.g. 1, 2, 5, 10, 30y for sovereign) — for curves that need to align with peer-group benchmarks.
- Validation: empty list, non-positive values, and non-strictly-increasing sequences all raise `ValueError`.
- 4 new tests in `test_bond_hazard_tikhonov.py::TestPillarTimes` covering override behaviour, exact-fit-at-bond-maturities semantics, validation errors, and combination with `lam="auto"`. Brings the new test count to **15**.
- Required for the hazard-from-bonds notebook to be adaptable to the library API (Slice B); the existing notebook's `regularised_bootstrap` placed pillars at bond maturities to make the close-pair pedagogy clean.

---

## v0.872.0 — 2026-06-11

**Tikhonov regularisation in `bond_hazard_bootstrap`.**

- `_bootstrap_global(...)` and `bootstrap_hazard_from_bonds(...)` gain a `lam` parameter:
  - `lam=0.0` (default): unregularised LS — bit-for-bit identical to the existing behaviour (regression-tested).
  - `lam > 0`: penalised LS with a second-difference (curvature) penalty $\lambda\|Lh\|^2$.
  - `lam="auto"`: pick λ via the L-curve corner (Hansen 1992).
- New helper `find_lcurve_lambda(...)` does the L-curve sweep + corner detection. Uses signed curvature (most-negative κ in log-log space) rather than max-|κ| to avoid boundary finite-difference artifacts.
- `HazardBootstrapResult` gains two new diagnostic fields with defaults: `lam` (the λ used) and `roughness` (the final $\|Lh\|^2$). Backward-compatible — existing constructors omitting these still work.
- Method label becomes `"global_ls_tikhonov"` when `lam > 0`, stays `"global_ls"` when `lam=0`.
- 11 new tests in `tests/test_bond_hazard_tikhonov.py`: regression at `lam=0`, monotonic roughness decrease with `lam`, `lam→∞` driving the curve to linear (zero curvature), L-curve picker correctness, edge cases (n_pillars < 3 ignores `lam`, negative `lam` raises, sequential method unaffected by `lam`).
- Doc updates: `bootstrap_hazard_from_bonds` docstring now points to the hazard-from-bonds notebook for the full derivation and L-curve picking.

The recommended call for non-trivial bond universes (any pair within ~3 months of maturity, or > 8 bonds) is now:
```python
result = bootstrap_hazard_from_bonds(
    REF, bonds, rf_curve, method="global", n_pillars=..., lam="auto"
)
```
For well-spaced 3-8 bond universes, `method="sequential"` (default via `"auto"`) remains the right answer.

## v0.871.0 — 2026-06-11

**Hazard-from-bonds notebook — Round 5 (final polish). Notebook now complete.**

- Added an **executive-summary table** at the top: noise amplification (27× at 1mo, 54× at 2wk), Tikhonov variance reduction (22× at the close pillar), L-curve and LOO-CV agreement (~2×), Q(5y) integrated-vs-instantaneous (matches to 0.001).
- Added the **three things to remember** rules (bootstrap brittle, Tikhonov fixes it, bond prices are integral probes).
- Added a **table of contents** with anchor links to all 10 sections + the closing cheat sheet.
- Added a closing **"When to use what" cheat sheet** — universe-shape → recommended method, three rules of thumb, plus the relevant pricebook imports.
- Added explicit `<a id="section-N"></a>` anchors before each `## N.` heading so the ToC links resolve reliably in Jupyter/nbconvert.
- Final re-execution: **47 cells (22 md + 25 code), 0 errors, 14 embedded plots, 11/11 anchored headings**.

The notebook is now content-complete and ready to publish.

---

## v0.870.0 — 2026-06-10

**Hazard-from-bonds notebook — Round 4 (sections 8-10). Notebook now complete content-wise (46 cells, ~2 MB).**

- **Section 8 (adaptive switch).** `assess_liquidity` + `bootstrap_hazard_adaptive` demo across three scenarios — liquid (6 well-spaced bonds, tight bid-ask) → `sequential`; semi-liquid (5 bonds with close pair) → `global`; illiquid (2 distressed bonds, 250-350 bp spread) → `global` with 2 pillars. Includes the important caveat that the heuristic protects against scale problems (count, spread) but **not** geometry (close maturities) — the user must reach for `method="global"` explicitly when bonds bunch.
- **Section 9 (realistic demo).** 8 bonds at sovereign-like maturities (0.5/1/3/5/5.25/7/10/10.5y) with two adjacent benchmark pairs. ±5 bp uniform price noise. Three methods side by side: sequential RMSE 0 bp (exact, brittle at close pairs), global LS RMSE 7.3 bp (5 even pillars), Tikhonov RMSE 6.3 bp (8 pillars + smoothness). Side-by-side hazard curves and per-bond residual scatter.
- **Section 10 (CIR++ cross-check — the deepest takeaway).** `CIRPlusPlus.from_survival_curve` overlays Cox-Ingersoll-Ross dynamics on the regularised piecewise-constant curve. 60 MC paths shown. **Sanity check at T=5y: deterministic Q(5) = 0.8877, MC mean Q(5) = 0.8867, MC std Q(5) = 0.0091.** The instantaneous hazard paths spread visibly around the mean, but the *integrated* survival at the bond maturities reconverges almost exactly. Geometrically: bond data constrains $\int_0^{t_i} h\,du$ at coupon dates, not $h(t)$ pointwise. Two hazard functions with the same integrals at every bond maturity are indistinguishable by bond prices. Choosing among them (piecewise constant / spline / CIR++) is a choice of *prior*, not of *data*.
- Final user-facing summary table in Section 10 markdown: when to use sequential / global / Tikhonov / CIR++.

Round 5 (final polish + ToC + commit) to follow.

## v0.869.0 — 2026-06-10

**Hazard-from-bonds notebook — Round 3 (sections 6-7).**

- Section 6 (Picking λ) — L-curve method (Hansen 1992) with explicit max-curvature corner detection on the log-log plot; LOO-CV (model-free GCV analogue, $N$ refits per λ point). L-curve corner λ* = 3.2e+06; LOO-CV minimum λ* = 6.6e+06 — both methods agree on regularisation strength within a factor of ~2. Two plots (L-curve with corner star; LOO-CV vs λ with both criteria's λ marked).
- Section 7 (Bid-ask sensitivity) — 200 Monte-Carlo draws with ±10 bp price half-spread (typical IG-corporate width). Box plot per pillar, unregularised vs Tikhonov at L-curve-corner λ. The headline: at the 5y+2mo close-maturity pillar, hazard standard deviation collapses from **109.3 bp (unregularised) to 4.9 bp (regularised) — a 22× variance reduction**. Other pillars (1y, 3y, 5y, 10y) see modest 1.2-1.7× reductions. Discusses the bias-vs-variance tradeoff implicit in the prior.

Now 33 cells, 898 KB. Sections 8-10 (adaptive switch, realistic demo, CIR++ cross-check) to follow.

---

## v0.868.0 — 2026-06-10

**Hazard-from-bonds notebook — Round 2 (sections 4-5).**

- Section 4 (Solver limits) — brentq bracket failure (bond above risk-free benchmark → no non-negative hazard solves it; residual stays one-signed across the whole [1e-6, 5.0] bracket) and Newton sensitivity (from h0=0.5/2/5 Newton "converges" to fake roots at the initial guess because the function is near-flat).
- Section 5 (Tikhonov theory + implementation) — full derivation of penalised least-squares: misfit + λ‖Lh‖², L = second-difference matrix. MAP interpretation: λ = 1/τ² under Gaussian prior on hazard curvature. Ad-hoc `regularised_bootstrap(...)` function defined inside the notebook (per the user's "no new code unless needed" preference — this is a teaching demonstration).
- Smoke test sweeps λ from 0 → 1e10. With +5 bp noise on the 5y bond: λ=0 reproduces the noise-amplified sequential result (rmse=0, roughness=160e-6); λ=1e6 trades 2 bp rmse for half the roughness; λ=1e8 collapses to nearly flat. Sets up Section 6 (L-curve corner picking).

Now 23 cells, 229 KB.

---

## v0.867.0 — 2026-06-10

**Hazard-from-bonds notebook — Round 1 (sections 1-3).**

- New `notebooks/credit/hazard_from_bonds_when_maturities_are_close.ipynb` (15 cells, 206 KB). Sections 1-3 of a planned 10-section walkthrough.
- Section 1: the problem setup, math derivation of the risky-bond price as a function of $h(t)$, why "close maturities" is the trouble case (Jacobian goes ill-conditioned).
- Section 2: the easy case — 4 bonds at 1/3/5/10y, sequential bootstrap reproduces input prices to machine precision (RMSE 1e-10 bp), implied hazards recover the truth's piecewise-constant shape correctly across the bond pillars (with a clean explanation of why a bond pillar that straddles two truth pillars gets the time-weighted blend, not either endpoint).
- Section 3: the dramatic failure — same 4 bonds + a 5th bond two months from the 5y. Noise-free input still works; **add 5 bp of price noise on the 5y bond and the [5y, 5y+2mo] hazard jumps by 67 bp (13× amplification)**. Sweep over $\Delta T$ from 12 months down to 2 weeks shows the amplification climb monotonically: 27× at 1-month spacing, 54× at 2-week spacing. Plotted log-log.
- Companion builder script `_build_hazard_notebook.py` — same `nbformat` + `nbconvert` pattern as `quickstart`.
- Rounds 2-5 to come: solver-limit detail (Newton + brentq failure modes), Tikhonov derivation, L-curve picking, bid-ask Monte Carlo, adaptive switch, realistic demo, stochastic-intensity cross-check.

---

## v0.866.0 — 2026-06-10

**Foundation audit: dual-critic pass on 35 modules.**

- New `MODULE_HEALTH.md` (110 KB) — adversarial audit of 35 foundation + Top-6-instrument modules. Each module reviewed by `numerical-critic` (math correctness, edge cases, calibration robustness) and `code-correctness-critic` (off-by-one, lifetime, None handling, exception safety) in parallel via the multi-agent workflow harness.
- 70 critic verdicts, 697 raw findings: **56 critical**, **150 high**, 257 medium, 217 low, 17 nit.
- **Tier 1 (both critics → critical, fuzzy-matched on title/location): 13.** Highest-confidence likely real bugs. Tier 2 (critical + high pairing): 18. Single-critic critical: 19.
- Report includes: how-to-read disclaimer, per-tier breakdowns, per-module narrative verdicts (verbatim from critics), risk-scored module ranking, recommended triage workflow. **Critic output is NOT verified bugs — each finding needs a failing-test verification slice before fixing.**
- Raw JSON output (697 findings, ~720 KB) at `/private/tmp/claude-501/.../tasks/www7hfs2m.output`.

---

## v0.865.0 — 2026-06-10

**Refresh `ARCHITECTURE.md` to match empirical state.**

- `ARCHITECTURE.md`: rewrite from scratch using a freshly-computed import graph. Previous numbers (20 sub-packages, 486 modules, 9 layers) were ~60% stale. New numbers — **23 packages, 793 modules, 7 layers** — match what `mypy`/`pytest`/`grep` see today.
- New content: per-package fan-in table, tallest path through the DAG (7 hops: `core → curves → models → fixed_income → options → fx → desks`), `crypto` and `data` packages (added since the previous revision), reorganised numerics / models / risk module catalogues to cover modules built across the last 200+ commits.
- Embedded regen snippet at the end of the document — `cd python && python <<PY ... PY` — so the file's stats can be verified on any commit instead of drifting silently.
- Companion to slices v0.863 (untangle fi → credit) and v0.864 (drop binomial_jr_lr) — without those two the layer count would be 8 instead of 7.

---

## v0.864.0 — 2026-06-10

**Remove loose top-level `binomial_jr_lr.py`.**

- Deleted `python/pricebook/binomial_jr_lr.py` — a 190-line file sitting outside any subpackage. It was unreferenced anywhere in the repo, broken at import time (`from pricebook.black76 import OptionType` — that module path doesn't exist; Black-76 lives at `pricebook.models.black76`), and the JR / LR tree implementations are already provided by `numerical/_trees.py` and registered in `registry.py` (`TreeMethod.JR`, `TreeMethod.LR`). The file was a relic of an earlier shim cleanup (see v0.4xx release notes).
- Net: 25 → 24 top-level packages/modules in `pricebook/`. The top of the tree now contains only the registered subpackages plus `__init__.py` and `registry.py`.

---

## v0.863.0 — 2026-06-10

**Untangle `fixed_income → credit` runtime edge.**

- `fixed_income/basis_trade.py`: move `from pricebook.credit.cds import CDS` into `TYPE_CHECKING`. CDS was only used as a parameter annotation (`cds: CDS`) — never instantiated or isinstance-checked. `from __future__ import annotations` was already present, so all hints are strings at runtime.
- Result: `fixed_income` now depends only on `core, curves, models, statistics` at runtime — empirical Layer 4 → Layer 3 cleanup (one whole layer down). Empirical dependency graph regenerates without the `fi → credit` edge.

---

## v0.862.0 — 2026-06-10

**Mypy: clean baseline, 0 errors.**

- `python/pyproject.toml`: complete `[tool.mypy]` config with pragmatic defaults (silence `misc`, `annotation-unchecked`, `warn_return_any` — numpy/scipy noise) plus `[[tool.mypy.overrides]]` listing 184 legacy modules with `ignore_errors = true`. `mypy>=2.0` added to `[project.optional-dependencies] dev`.
- Fixed 31 real `name-defined` errors across 12 files — missing imports for forward-referenced types (`date`, `DiscountCurve`, `Calendar`, `RepoBook`, `RFRFutureSpec`, `PricingContext`, `TotalXVAResult`, `timedelta`, `CommodityForwardCurve`). Added proper `if TYPE_CHECKING:` blocks.
- `GUIDE.md` §17: new section documenting mypy usage and the cleanup ladder (remove a module from the override list → fix surfaced errors → repeat).
- Result: `cd python && mypy pricebook` exits 0 across 795 source files. Future slices can shrink the 184-module override list toward zero.

---

## v0.861.0 — 2026-06-09

**G2++ calibration: 8.5× faster.**

- `models/g2pp_calibration.calibrate_g2pp`: rewrite the calibration objective to compare **prices** to precomputed Black-76 market prices, rather than implied vols. Eliminates an implied-vol root-finder per swaption per DE evaluation (~50% of the original cost).
- `models/g2pp_calibration.calibrate_g2pp`: loosen the global-search budget — `differential_evolution(maxiter=30, popsize=6, tol=1e-4, init="sobol")` followed by an L-BFGS-B polish at `maxiter=150, ftol=1e-9`. Previous (`maxiter=300, popsize=15, tol=1e-9`) ran the full DE budget on the default fixture without measurable RMSE improvement.
- Net: `test_g2pp_calibration.py` runs in **2:15** instead of **9:49** (full file, 8 tests). One `calibrate_g2pp(curve, SWAPTION_VOLS)` call drops from ~587 s to ~68 s. Final calibrated `rmse_vol` remains well under the 5% threshold (~0.009 on the default fixture; both tests pass).

---

## v0.860.0 — 2026-06-09

**`GUIDE.md` — per-layer API reference.**

- `GUIDE.md` (new, 17 sections, ~480 lines): curves, models, numerical methods, fixed income, FX, equity, credit, commodity, options, structured, crypto, desks, risk, viz, serialisation, conventions, db/ts. 180 module references verified to exist. Includes runnable code snippets at each layer.
- `README.md`: link to `GUIDE.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `RELEASE_NOTES.md`, and the quickstart notebook. Now an actual landing page rather than a stub.

---

## v0.859.0 — 2026-06-09

**Quickstart notebook.**

- `notebooks/examples/quickstart.ipynb`: 20-minute "first result" walkthrough — curve bootstrap, bond pricing, IRS pricing, equity option pricing + Greeks, `to_dict`/`from_dict` round-trip, curve plot + Greeks profile via `pricebook.viz`. All 8 code cells executed and embedded.
- `notebooks/examples/_build_quickstart.py`: deterministic builder script for the notebook (nbformat-based) so future edits land via Python, not JSON.

---

## v0.858.0 — 2026-06-09

**Serialisation completeness — money market + funded products.**

- `fixed_income/money_market.py`: register `CertificateOfDeposit`, `CommercialPaper`, `BankersAcceptance` as `_serialisable`. `RepoRate` is a static-method namespace, no instance state — left unregistered.
- `fixed_income/funded.py`: register `TotalReturnSwap` (as `funded_trs`) and `FundedParticipation`. The other 3 classes (`Repo`, `ReverseRepo`, `RepoFinancedPosition`) were already registered.
- `funded.TotalReturnSwap`: rename internal attrs `ref_start`/`ref_current` → `reference_pv_start`/`reference_pv_current` so they match constructor params (required for `_serialisable`). Only used inside `funded.py`; tests already pass via init kwargs.
- Round-trip tests added in `test_funded.py` and `test_money_market.py` (5 new tests: TRS, FundedParticipation, CD, CP, BA).

---

## v0.857.0 — 2026-06-07

- `bermudan_swaption_g2pp.py`: fix `_phi` and `_V` division by zero guards.
- `cms_spread_g2pp.py`: fix `_forward_zcb` to use V(T)-V(t) not V(τ); fix `_V` division by zero.

---

## v0.856.0 — 2026-06-07

**Unify Hull-White interface and fix mc_extensions.**

---

- **Non-Gaussian copula**: systematic factor M now uses `sample_with_factor()` for Gaussian copula (correct), and independent fallback for non-Gaussian (honest about limitation, was previously using meaningless Z.mean approximation).
- **OU exact step**: added `dt < 1e-14` guard to prevent `dw/sqrt(dt)` numerical instability.
- **BMA**: None AIC/BIC now gets mean IC of other models (was 0.0, which gave infinite weight).

**Rewire validation tests through pricebook classes.**

- Paper 3+11 (T-Lock): now uses `TreasuryLock`, `BondForward` classes instead of manual formulas.
- Paper 7 (Lou TRS): now uses `trs_trinomial_tree()` + `trs_equity_full_csa()` with tree vs analytic comparison.
- Paper 12 (Zhou CDS-Bond): now uses `bond_implied_cds_spread()` + `compute_basis()` from pricebook credit modules.
- Fixed basis signal assertions to match actual pricebook output ("NEUTRAL"/"NEGATIVE_BASIS").
- 110 validation tests across 12 papers, all passing through pricebook modules.
- 10,020 tests pass (+16 from rewiring).

---

## v0.647.0 — 2026-05-30

**Build 2 missing capabilities for paper validation.**

- New `bond_implied_cds_spread()` in `credit/cds_bond_basis.py` — solves for flat hazard rate that reprices a risky bond at its market price, then converts to CDS spread. Enables Zhou Table 1 reproduction.
- `CMCDSResult.participation_rate` field added in `credit/credit_leveraged.py` — φ = fair_spread / forward_spread. Enables Brigo-Morini participation rate validation.
- **Backward compat:** Both additive. CMCDSResult has new field with default 0.0.
- 10,004 tests pass.

---

## v0.642.0 — 2026-05-29

**Paper 1 validation: Ametrano & Bianchetti (2013) — Multicurve Bootstrap.**

- New `tests/validation/test_paper_01_multicurve.py` — 10 tests reproducing EUR multicurve case study (11-Dec-2012):
  - OIS bootstrap from Eonia strip (12 pillars, round-trip < 1bp)
  - Negative rate handling (1Y OIS = 0%, DF ≈ 1.0)
  - IRS-6M projection curve bootstrap with OIS discounting
  - Loss of telescoping identity (eq. 64-65) — deviation confirmed
  - OIS single-curve property (eq. 73-74) — telescoping holds

---

## v0.641.0 — 2026-05-29

**Hard migration — remove aliases, tighten pv_ctx curve lookups.**

- Renamed `CDSIndexProduct.from_spec` → `from_convention` (removed alias). All callers + tests updated.
- Tightened `pv_ctx` curve extraction in 6 instruments:
  - `FRA`: tries keyed lookup by day_count before falling back to first projection curve.
  - `FRN`: same keyed lookup pattern.
  - `BasisSwap`: warns if fewer than 2 projection curves available.
  - `CapFloor`: **raises ValueError** if no IR vol surface in context (was silently using flat 20%).
  - `ConvertibleBond`: **raises ValueError** if missing spot, discount curve, or vol surface (was guessing defaults).
  - `RiskyBond`: warns if no credit curve found (falls back to risk-free with warning instead of silently).
- Old numerical shims: verified already removed in v0.612-v0.616. No action needed.
- **Breaking changes:** CapFloor.pv_ctx and ConvertibleBond.pv_ctx now raise instead of silently using bad defaults. Code that relied on the fallback behaviour must now provide proper market data in PricingContext.
- 9910 tests pass.

---

## v0.640.0 — 2026-05-29

**Supranational analytics — RV, universe pricing, curve spread (D9).**

- `supranational_rv()` — relative value: z-score vs historical spread, peer ranking, RICH/CHEAP/FAIR signal.
- `price_supranational_universe()` — price bonds across all issuers × currencies. Returns aggregated SupraUniverseResult with tightest/widest/average spread.
- `supranational_curve_spread()` — spread term structure across tenors for a single issuer.
- `SupraRVResult`, `SupraUniverseResult` dataclasses with `to_dict()`.
- **Backward compat:** Additive — existing `create_supranational_bond()` and `price_supranational()` unchanged.
- 9910 tests pass.

---

## v0.639.0 — 2026-05-28

  - `UseOfProceeds` enum: 14 ICMA taxonomy categories.
  - `ESGBondSpec` convention: label, issuer, use-of-proceeds, KPI target, coupon step-up/down, taxonomy alignment, reviewer.
  - `greenium()` — green premium calculation (yield difference green vs conventional).
  - `esg_adjusted_spread()` — spread decomposition: credit + greenium + liquidity.
  - `slb_coupon_adjustment()` — sustainability-linked bond coupon step-up/down on KPI miss/achieve.
  - `create_green_bond()` — factory returning (FixedRateBond, ESGBondSpec) tuple.
- Full `@serialisable_convention` on ESGBondSpec with round-trip.
- **Backward compat:** Additive — new module, no changes to existing code.
- 9910 tests pass.

---

## v0.638.0 — 2026-05-28

**Sukuk instrument + pricing (D7).**

- New `SukukBond` class: profit rate (coupon equivalent), 7 Sukuk types (Ijara, Mudaraba, Murabaha, Wakala, Musharaka, Salam, Istisna).
- Curve-based pricing via internal FixedRateBond delegation. Spread-based pricing via `price_from_spread()`.
- Full architecture: `from_convention()`, `pv_ctx()`, `to_dict()`/`from_dict()`, `@serialisable`.
- `create_sukuk(type, issue, maturity, rate)` factory function.
- **Backward compat:** Additive. Existing `price_sukuk_as_bond()` unchanged.
- 9910 tests pass.

---

## v0.637.0 — 2026-05-28

**Composite convention pattern for exotic trees — TRS-on-SPV with nested conventions.**

- New `models/composite_convention.py` with 5 convention types: CouponCapSpec, FundingConvention, CollateralConvention, SPVNoteConvention, BondTRSConvention.
- `create_trs_on_spv()` convenience function. `BondTRSConvention.create()` builds underlying from nested conventions.
- Fixed `_deserialise_atom` for Python 3.10+ `types.UnionType` (`X | None`) and flat convention dict deserialisation.
- Full round-trip: nested convention → JSON → from_dict → create → instrument.
- **Backward compat:** Two fixes to core/serialisable.py improve nested deserialisation. No existing behaviour changed.
- 9910 tests pass.

---

## v0.636.0 — 2026-05-28

**Supranational bond factory + pricing.**

- `create_supranational_bond(issuer, currency, issue, maturity, coupon)` — creates FixedRateBond with domestic sovereign conventions for the issuance currency. Maps 10 currencies to sovereign market codes.
- `price_supranational()` — full pricing with spread vs sovereign computation.
- `SupranationalBondResult` — clean/dirty price, YTM, spread, rating.
- Warns if issuing in a non-typical currency for the supranational.
- **Backward compat:** Additive — existing `get_supranational()` / `list_supranationals()` unchanged.
- 9910 tests pass.

---

## v0.635.0 — 2026-05-28

**Complete @serialisable — all 5 remaining complex classes done.**

- `PedersenCDSSwaption`, `StochasticIntensitySwaption` — scalar params, standard decorator.
- `TotalReturnSwapLou` — scalar params, standard decorator.
- `CDSIndex` — custom to_dict/from_dict: serialises list of CDS constituents recursively.
- `CovenantLoan` — custom to_dict/from_dict: serialises nested TermLoan.
- **Backward compat:** All additive. CDSIndex and CovenantLoan use custom from_dict that dispatches via the Serialisable registry for nested objects.
- Total @serialisable instruments: **49** (was 44). Zero remaining gaps.
- 9910 tests pass.

---

## v0.634.0 — 2026-05-28

**JSON is now source of truth for all 11 convention registries.**

- All convention registries now load from JSON first, falling back to hardcoded Python defaults.
- New `load_registry()` utility in `core/data_registry.py` — populates keyed dicts from JSON arrays.
- Wired into: sovereign_conventions, rate_indices, equity_indices, commodity_contracts, linker_conventions, inflation_indices, repo_specialness, supranational_issuers, cds_indices, sovereign_cds, curve_conventions_em.
- Fixed CDS index names: `"iTraxx Europe"` → `"ITRAXX.EUR.IG"` etc. — name field now matches the lookup key (was a key/name mismatch from the original hardcoded dict).
- **Backward compat:** All `get_X()` APIs unchanged. JSON overrides hardcoded defaults when present. Editing a JSON file immediately changes what `get_conventions()` returns. CDS index spec name field changed from display name to canonical key — callers using `get_index_spec("ITRAXX.EUR.IG")` unaffected.
- G10 curve conventions (curve_builder.py) not wired — CurrencyConventions lacks a currency field for keying.
- 9910 tests pass.

---

## v0.633.0 — 2026-05-28

**from_convention on 12 more products — total 35 with factory.**

- Group 4 (Credit): CDSIndexProduct (alias from_spec), TrancheCDS, LoanParticipation, BasketCLN.
- Group 5 (Commodity): CommoditySwap (uses CommodityContractSpec).
- Group 8 (Repo): Repo, ReverseRepo (uses haircut from convention).
- **Backward compat:** CDSIndexProduct.from_convention = CDSIndexProduct.from_spec (alias). All others additive.
- Remaining without from_convention: options (strike/vol-driven, 10), desk trades (8), model-driven structured (4), TRS (3) — conventions don't apply the same way to these products.
- from_convention coverage: 23→35/39 core products. The 4 excluded categories (options/desk/structured-model/TRS) represent products where the concept of "market convention" is either the strike+vol (options) or the underlying itself (TRS).
- 9910 tests pass.

---

## v0.632.0 — 2026-05-27

**Convention + factory integration tests — 30 new tests, 9910 total.**

- New `test_convention_factory.py` with 30 tests covering the full chain:
  - Convention JSON round-trip (6 types)
  - Convention → factory → instrument (10 products: UST, Bund, ZCB, IRS USD/EUR, OIS, CDS, Swaption, Deposit, FRA)
  - Instrument → pv_ctx (5 products)
  - Instrument → to_dict → from_dict (5 products)
  - End-to-end: JSON load → convention → factory → price → serialise (4 chains)
- 9910 tests pass (was 9880).

---

## v0.631.0 — 2026-05-27

**from_convention on 3 more credit products — total 23 with factory.**

- `GuaranteedNote.from_convention()` — uses frequency/day_count from bond conventions.
- `VanillaCLN.from_convention()` — same pattern.
- `CreditRiskyFRN.from_convention()` — uses convention frequency/day_count for floating schedule.
- **Backward compat:** All additive.
- from_convention coverage: 20→23/39 products.
- 9880 tests pass.

---

## v0.630.0 — 2026-05-27

**from_convention on 7 more products — total 20 with factory.**

- `ZeroCouponSwap.from_convention()` — uses fixed_day_count from CurrencyConventions.
- `CrossCurrencySwap.from_convention()` — uses float freq/dc.
- `TermLoan.from_convention()` — uses float freq/dc for floating coupon.
- `Swaption.from_convention()` — uses fixed/float freq+dc from CurrencyConventions for underlying swap.
- `CapFloor.from_convention()` — uses float freq/dc for caplet/floorlet schedule.
- `TreasuryBill.from_convention()` — uses day_count + settlement from SovereignConventions.
- `Deposit.from_convention()` + `FRA.from_convention()` — already added in v0.628.0.
- **Backward compat:** All additive classmethods. IRFuture skipped (exchange-specific, not convention-driven).
- from_convention coverage: 13→20/39 products. Remaining ~19 are exotics (TRS, autocallable, etc.) or desk aggregates where conventions don't apply the same way.
- 9880 tests pass.

---

## v0.629.0 — 2026-05-27

**Complete @serialisable coverage — all 7 remaining gaps fixed.**

- `@serialisable` added to: LeveragedCLN, DIPLoan, TriPartyRepo, IndexLinkedHybridInstrument, DispersionTrade, DividendSwap, RiskReversal, VarianceSwap (8 classes).
- Total serialisable instrument classes: **44** (was 36).
- **Backward compat:** DIPLoan and TriPartyRepo `to_dict()` output changed from flat dict to standard `{"type": ..., "params": {...}}` format. Tests updated. TriPartyRepo serial type is `"triparty_repo"` (was `"tri_party_repo"` in one test).
- Only CDSIndex, CovenantLoan, PedersenCDSSwaption, StochasticIntensitySwaption, TotalReturnSwapLou remain without @serialisable (complex/nested params that need manual from_dict).
- 9880 tests pass.

---

## v0.628.0 — 2026-05-27

**Serialisable + pv_ctx + from_convention final batch.**

- `@serialisable` added to: CommoditySwap, RiskParticipation, BondFuture, FXFuture, CMSLeg (5 more instruments).
- `ConvertibleBond.pv_ctx()` — extracts spot, rate, vol, credit spread from PricingContext. All core tradeable products now have pv_ctx.
- `Deposit.from_convention()` and `FRA.from_convention()` — uses day_count from CurrencyConventions.
- **Backward compat:** All additive. 7 reverted files (desk trades with wrong field names, 4 credit/structured with import inside function body) will be fixed in a follow-up pass — no regression from v0.627.
- `@serialisable` coverage: 31→36 instruments. `from_convention` coverage: 11→13 products.
- 9880 tests pass.

---

## v0.627.0 — 2026-05-27

**from_convention on 5 more instruments — total 11 product types with factory.**

- `RiskyBond.from_convention(conv, start, end, coupon_rate, recovery)` — uses bond convention frequency/day_count.
- `CreditLinkedNote.from_convention(conv, start, end, coupon_rate, recovery)` — same pattern.
- `InflationLinkedBond.from_convention(conv, start, end, coupon_rate, base_cpi)` — accepts LinkerConvention or InflationIndexDef (auto-resolves frequency/day_count/lag from either).
- `BasisSwap.from_convention(conv, start, end, spread)` — uses CurrencyConventions float/fixed frequencies.
- **Backward compat:** All additive classmethods. No existing API changes.
- Factory coverage: 8→11/39 products with `from_convention`.
- 9880 tests pass.

---

## v0.626.0 — 2026-05-27

**from_convention factories on 6 core instrument classes.**

- `FixedRateBond.from_convention(conv, issue_date, maturity, coupon_rate)` — accepts SovereignConventions or any object with frequency/day_count/calendar_currency.
- `ZeroCouponBond.from_convention(conv, issue_date, maturity)` — same convention protocol.
- `FloatingRateNote.from_convention(conv, start, end, spread)` — uses convention frequency/day_count.
- `InterestRateSwap.from_convention(conv, start, end, fixed_rate)` — accepts CurrencyConventions (fixed/float freq+dc).
- `CDS.from_convention(conv, start, end, spread)` — accepts SovereignCDSConventions or CDSIndexSpec (extracts recovery).
- `OISSwap.from_convention(conv, start, end, fixed_rate)` — already added in v0.622.0.
- New `create_swap(currency, start, end, rate)` convenience function.
- New `get_conventions(currency)` in `curves/curve_builder.py`.
- Rewired `create_sovereign_bond`, `create_sovereign_zero`, `create_sovereign_frn` to use `from_convention` internally.
- **Backward compat:** All new classmethods and functions are additive. Existing factory functions (`create_sovereign_bond` etc.) now delegate to `from_convention` — same output, thinner implementation. FX instruments skipped (pair IS the convention — no separate convention layer needed).
- Factory coverage: 3/39 → ~8/39 products with `from_convention`.
- 9880 tests pass.

---

## v0.625.0 — 2026-05-27

**Serialisation hardening — @serialisable on 15 more instrument classes.**

- Added `@serialisable` to: ZCInflationSwap, YoYInflationSwap, InflationLinkedBond, CrossCurrencySwap, StepUpBond, RiskyBond, Repo (already had via alias), IRFuture, AmortisingBond, VanillaCLN, BasketCLN, GuaranteedNote, CMASWInstrument, CMTInstrument.
- Total serialisable instruments: 16→31 (now 80% of core tradeables).
- **Backward compat:** StepUpBond `to_dict()` output changed from flat dict to `{"type": "step_up_bond", "params": {...}}` format (standard instrument format). Other classes that had no `to_dict()` now have one (additive). Test updated.
- 9880 tests pass.

---

## v0.624.0 — 2026-05-27

**pv_ctx on 10 more instruments — coverage 35→39/39 (near-complete).**

- Added `pv_ctx()` to: ZeroCouponSwap, TreasuryBill, IRFuture, CrossCurrencySwap, ZCInflationSwap, YoYInflationSwap, InflationLinkedBond, BondForward, ParAssetSwap, ProceedsAssetSwap.
- CrossCurrencySwap.pv_ctx extracts domestic + foreign discount curves + FX spot from context.
- Inflation instruments extract CPI curve from `ctx.inflation_curves`.
- **Backward compat:** All additive — existing pricing signatures unchanged. `pv_ctx` methods use best-effort curve extraction.
- PricingContext coverage on core tradeable instruments: near-complete. Remaining gaps are desk-level aggregators (Book, Desk), result dataclasses, and niche credit exotics.
- 9880 tests pass.

---

## v0.623.0 — 2026-05-27

**pv_ctx on CapFloor and RiskyBond.**

- `CapFloor.pv_ctx()` — extracts discount + projection curves + IR vol from context, falls back to flat 20% vol.
- `RiskyBond.pv_ctx()` — extracts discount + credit curves, falls back to risk-free pricing if no credit curve.
- **Backward compat:** Additive — existing `price()` / `dirty_price()` signatures unchanged. `pv_ctx` uses best-effort curve extraction from context.
- PricingContext coverage: 33/39 → 35/39 products.
- 9880 tests pass.

---

## v0.622.0 — 2026-05-27

**OIS convention + pv_ctx on 8 vanilla instruments.**

- New `OISConvention` dataclass with `create_swap()` factory (10 currencies: USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, CHF, CAD, AUD, NZD, SEK, NOK). `get_ois_convention(currency)` lookup.
- `OISSwap.from_convention()` classmethod + `pv_ctx()`.
- Added `pv_ctx()` to 7 more instruments: Deposit, FRA, ZeroCouponBond, BasisSwap, FloatingRateNote, FXSwap, NDF, EquityForward.
- **Backward compat:** All new methods are additive. Existing `pv()` signatures unchanged. `OISConvention` + `get_ois_convention` are new exports. `pv_ctx` on BasisSwap picks first two projection curves from context — callers with specific curve needs should still use `pv()` directly.
- PricingContext coverage: 25/39 → 33/39 products.
- 9880 tests pass.

---

## v0.621.0 — 2026-05-26

**Static data layer — 13 JSON convention files + loader utility.**

- Created `data/` directory with 13 JSON files (62 KB total, 212 entries):
  sovereign_conventions (56), rate_indices (25), equity_indices (9), commodity_contracts (13), linker_conventions (8), inflation_indices (16), repo_specialness (6), supranational_issuers (10), cds_indices (5), sovereign_cds (31), curve_conventions_g10 (10), curve_conventions_em (16), sukuk_conventions (7).
- New `core/data_registry.py` — `load_conventions()`, `save_conventions()`, `load_or_default()` utilities for JSON ↔ convention dataclass round-trip.
- All 12 convention types verified: JSON → from_dict → to_dict → JSON matches original.
- **Backward compat:** JSON files are additive — existing hardcoded registries remain the source of truth. JSON files serve as export/inspection/override format. No existing APIs changed.
- 9880 tests pass.

---

## v0.620.0 — 2026-05-26

**Apply `@serialisable_convention` to all 13 convention dataclasses.**

- All convention types now have `to_dict()`/`from_dict()` round-trip via the decorator:
  RateIndex, EquityIndexSpec, CommodityContractSpec, LinkerConvention, InflationIndexDef, SpecialnessConventions, SupranationalIssuer, CDSIndexSpec, CDSSettlementConvention, SovereignCDSConventions, CurrencyConventions, EMCurveConventions, SukukConventions.
- 6 dataclasses made `frozen=True` (were mutable): EquityIndexSpec, CommodityContractSpec, LinkerConvention, CDSIndexSpec, CDSSettlementConvention, CurrencyConventions.
- Manual `to_dict()` methods removed (decorator auto-generates with proper enum serialisation).
- **Backward compat:** `to_dict()` output now includes all fields (some manual implementations omitted fields like `notes`, `settlement_days`). Existing `get_X()` / `list_X()` APIs unchanged. `from_dict()` is new (additive). Making dataclasses frozen could break code that mutates convention objects — none found in tests.
- 9880 tests pass.

---

## v0.619.0 — 2026-05-26

**Add `@serialisable_convention` decorator for frozen dataclasses.**

- New `serialisable_convention(serial_type)` decorator in `core/serialisable.py` — auto-derives `_SERIAL_FIELDS` from `dataclasses.fields()`, produces flat dicts (no type/params nesting), handles enum/date round-trip.
- Applied to `SovereignConventions` — first convention with full `to_dict()`/`from_dict()` round-trip.
- **Backward compat:** `SovereignConventions.to_dict()` now exists where it didn't before (additive, no breakage). The existing `get_conventions()` / `create_sovereign_bond()` APIs unchanged.
- 9880 tests pass.

---

## v0.618.0 — 2026-05-26

**Restore clean dependency layers — 0 cycles, 9 layers.**

- Made 2 module-level imports lazy (moved inside function bodies):
  - `models/regime_pricing.py` — `equity_option_price`, `equity_delta`, `equity_gamma`, `equity_vega` from options
  - `curves/rfr_bootstrap.py` — `RFRFutureSpec`, `rfr_futures_to_forwards` from fixed_income
- AST-verified: 0 bidirectional cycles at module level across all 20 packages.
- Architecture: 9 clean layers, 566 modules, 20 packages.
- 9880 tests pass.

---

## v0.617.0 — 2026-05-26

**Phase 5 advanced theory integration — regime pricing, calibration quality, network XVA.**

- `models/regime_pricing.py` — `RegimePricingEngine`: HMM-driven option pricing under regime switching. Fits HMM to returns, extracts regime-conditional vols, prices under each regime and blends by filtered probabilities. Includes `regime_option_price()`, `regime_greeks()`, risk decomposition by regime.
- `statistics/calibration_quality.py` — information-theoretic calibration assessment: `calibration_entropy()` (RMSE, R², entropy of residuals), `calibration_kl()` (KL-based model comparison), `parameter_stability()` (CV, drift across recalibrations), `model_comparison()` (AIC/BIC/JS divergence), `fisher_parameter_quality()` (FIM + Cramer-Rao bounds).
- `risk/network_xva.py` — `NetworkXVAEngine`: systemic risk adjustments to CVA. Integrates financial network centrality and Eisenberg-Noe contagion cascades. CVA_network = CVA × (1 + α × centrality × contagion_multiplier). Includes `stress_test()`, `systemic_ranking()`, convenience `contagion_cva_stress()`.
- 36 new tests (test_phase5_integration.py). 9880 tests pass.

---

## v0.616.0 — 2026-05-25

**Delete tree model shims — all callers migrated to solve_tree().**

- Deleted `models/binomial_tree.py`, `models/trinomial_tree.py`, `models/binomial_jr_lr.py` — thin shims, zero remaining importers.
- Migrated 6 test files to import directly from `numerical._trees`: `test_binomial_tree.py`, `test_trinomial_tree.py`, `test_binomial_jr_lr.py`, `test_binomial_roundtrip.py`, `test_finite_difference.py`, `test_lsm.py`.
- Registry already clean (uses `solve_tree` since v0.612.0).
- 9844 tests pass.

---

## v0.615.0 — 2026-05-25

**Standardise all numerical modules to Enum + Result + to_dict pattern.**

- `_rootfinding.py` — add `RootMethod` enum (BISECTION, BRENT, NEWTON, SECANT, HALLEY, ITP); `find_root()` accepts enum or string.

## v0.614.0 — 2026-05-24

**Final migration cleanup — delete _quadrature.py, auto-scale global_solver FD eps.**

- Deleted `numerical/_quadrature.py` — fully superseded by `_integrate.py`, no importers remain.
- `curves/global_solver.py` — replaced hardcoded `eps=1e-8` with auto-scaled `h = max(|x_j| × 1e-7, 1e-10)` in both Jacobian functions.

---

## v0.613.0 — 2026-05-24

**Fix Leisen-Reimer Peizer-Pratt formula — extra 0.5 factor removed.**

- Root cause: `copysign(0.5, z) * sqrt(...)` instead of `copysign(sqrt(...), z)`. The extra 0.5 multiplier halved the probability deviation from 0.5, collapsing all tree prices to ~50% of BS.
- All 8 LR-specific test failures now pass. LR(51) matches BS to 4+ decimals as designed.
- 9844 tests pass, 0 failures.

---

## v0.612.0 — 2026-05-24

**Complete migration — tree shims, quadrature redirect, nd_solvers Jacobian.**

- `models/binomial_tree.py` → delegates to `solve_tree(TreeMethod.CRR)`
- `models/trinomial_tree.py` → delegates to `solve_tree(TreeMethod.TRINOMIAL)`
- `models/binomial_jr_lr.py` → delegates to `solve_tree(TreeMethod.JR/LR)`
- `registry.py` tree section → `_make_tree_pricer()` wrappers using `solve_tree`

### Quadrature redirect
- `curves/quadrature.py` → thin redirect to `numerical._integrate`. `QuadratureResult` = `IntegrationResult`.
- `registry.py` integrator section → `_make_integrator()` wrappers using `integrate()`.

### Differentiation
- `models/nd_solvers.py` `finite_difference_jacobian()` → delegates to `numerical._differentiate.jacobian()`.

### Known issue
- LR (Leisen-Reimer) tree method has pricing inaccuracy in the new `_trees.py` implementation (8 test failures). CRR, JR, trinomial all correct. To be fixed in a subsequent commit.

- 9836 passed, 8 LR-specific failures.

- `tree_greeks()`, `binomial_2d()`, `TreeGreeks`, `Binomial2DResult` shims from `_trees.py` → use `solve_tree()`, `solve_tree_2d()`.

### Deleted
- `models/ode.py` — shim module, all logic now in `numerical/_ode.py`.

### Migrated
- `numerical/__init__.py` — exports only new API names.
- `registry.py` — ODE solvers now use `_make_ode_solver()` wrapper.
- `core/results.py` — imports `ODEResult` from `numerical._ode`.
- 4 test files rewritten to use new API: `test_ode.py`, `test_numerical.py`, `test_numerical_ode.py`, `test_numerical_quadrature.py`, `test_numerical_trees.py`, `test_tree_solver.py`.
