## v0.892.0 — 2026-06-11

**Fix A.2 B1a — `LondonCalendar` Saturday substitution now follows UK Banking and Financial Dealings Act 1971.**

First of four per-calendar fixes for audit finding A.2 B1. London was producing wrong observed-holiday dates whenever a fixed-date bank holiday fell on a Saturday — recurring every ~6 years (2021, 2027, 2032, ...).

### What was broken

`Calendar._observe` is the US rule (5 U.S.C. § 6103): Saturday → previous Friday, Sunday → next Monday. London inherited that rule unchanged.

UK Banking and Financial Dealings Act 1971 specifies: any bank holiday on Saturday or Sunday is observed the **next working day** (typically Monday).

Live repro before the fix — Christmas 2021 (Dec 25 Saturday):
```
2021-12-24 Fri: was holiday=True  (wrong — should be a business day)
2021-12-27 Mon: was holiday=True  (right, by accident, because Boxing-Day-Sun lands here)
2021-12-28 Tue: was business=True (wrong — should be Boxing observed)
```

After the fix:
```
2021-12-24 Fri: business day ✓
2021-12-27 Mon: Christmas observed ✓
2021-12-28 Tue: Boxing Day observed ✓
```

### Change

- `calendar.py:93-101` — `Calendar._observe` docstring clarified as "US-style" with a cross-reference to the new helper.
- `calendar.py:103-128` (new) — `Calendar._observe_next_working_day` static helper implements the UK / AU / NZ / CA rule (Sat → +2 days, Sun → +1 day). Per-locale subclasses opt in via `_observe = staticmethod(Calendar._observe_next_working_day)`.
- `calendar.py:LondonCalendar` overrides `_observe` to the next-working-day rule. Existing Boxing/Christmas collision handling (when both land on the same observed Monday) is unaffected — that code already pushes Boxing to Tuesday when the collision happens.
- 6 new tests in `test_calendar.py::TestLondonCalendarSubstitution`: Christmas 2021/2024/2027, Boxing 2021, New Year's 2028 Sat case, New Year's 2023 Sun case.
- Full parallel suite: **11848 passed in 4:42** — no regressions.

### Affected upstream

Any GBP-rate calculation that crosses a Saturday-Christmas, Saturday-Boxing, or Saturday-New-Year window. Days affected per affected year: 4 (one Friday wrongly closed; one Tuesday wrongly open; mirror at New Year). Years materially affected in the GBP curve's lookback window: 2021, 2027 (already past for 2021; 2027 lookback materially affects long-dated forwards observed today).

### Remaining (queued)

Same fix shape applies to `AUDCalendar`, `NZDCalendar`, `CADCalendar` — each as its own slice (separate failure surfaces, easier rollback).

## v0.891.0 — 2026-06-11

**Fix A.12 B1 — serialisation auto-discovery via `pkgutil.walk_packages`.**

The hand-maintained import whitelist in `core.serialization._ensure_loaded` is gone. The registry is now populated by walking every submodule of `pricebook` on first use.

### What was broken

`_ensure_loaded` was a curated list of 24 imports. The audit found 53 files in the codebase using `@serialisable` / `@serialisable_convention` / `_register` — so **29 modules' types were silently absent from the registry**. The failure mode was: `from_dict({"type": "esg_bond_spec", ...})` → `ValueError("Unknown type 'esg_bond_spec'")` — but only when the specific missing type was deserialised, after deployment. Every new module with a serialisable type carried this maintenance trap.

### Change

- `serialization.py:30-65` — `_ensure_loaded` now uses `pkgutil.walk_packages(pricebook.__path__, prefix="pricebook.")` + `importlib.import_module`. Idempotent; one-shot tree walk on first call. Any import failure is recorded in `_failed_imports` (module name + exception class) rather than silenced — visible to the test suite for CI catch.
- Auto-discovery now registers **120 types** (vs ~50 with the old whitelist). The codebase has not changed; the registry just sees what was always there.
- 4 new tests in `test_serialization_autodiscovery.py`: zero-import-failures invariant, ≥100 types registered, every major subpackage represented, regression test that `EquityIndexSpec` (from `core.market_conventions`, not in the old whitelist) is now reachable.
- Full parallel suite: **11842 passed in 4:41**.

### Side discovery — new audit finding

Auto-discovery surfaces a pre-existing `_SERIAL_FIELDS` mismatch on `AmortisingBond` — the registered fields (`face_value`, `coupon_rate`, `n_periods`, `frequency`) don't match `__init__` parameters (`amortisation_type`, `coupon_rate`, `maturity_years`, `n_payments`, `notional`). The `_register` validator emits a `UserWarning` at startup. This bug was hidden before because `amortising_bond` wasn't in the old whitelist. **Logged as a new audit finding** — to be fixed in the upcoming `amortising_bond` audit pass.

---

## v0.890.0 — 2026-06-11

**Fix A.4 B1 — `schedule.generate_schedule` EOM convention now anchors on `start` per ISDA 2006 §4.10.**

The first fix landing from the L0 audit. Schedule generation now correctly interprets the EOM rule for *all* generation paths (front-stub backward AND back-stub forward), not just the forward path that happened to work by accident.

### What was broken

In the front-stub (backward) generation path, the EOM decision was made inside `_add_months(d, months, eom)` by checking whether the rolling date `d` was itself EOM. For backward generation, `d` starts as `end`, so EOM was effectively anchored to `end`. When `start` was EOM but `end` was not, interior coupon rolls landed mid-month — violating ISDA 2006 §4.10 ("if the period start date is the last day of February, the period end date is the last day of February").

Live repro before the fix:
```
generate_schedule(start=2024-01-31, end=2024-08-15, semi-annual, SHORT_FRONT, eom=True)
  → [2024-01-31, 2024-02-15, 2024-08-15]      ← Feb 15 wrong; should be Feb 29
generate_schedule(start=2024-01-31, end=2025-04-15, semi-annual, SHORT_FRONT, eom=True)
  → [2024-01-31, 2024-04-15, 2024-10-15, 2025-04-15]   ← interior rolls all mid-month
```

After the fix:
```
[2024-01-31, 2024-02-29, 2024-08-15]
[2024-01-31, 2024-04-30, 2024-10-31, 2025-04-15]
```

### Change

- `schedule.py:25-30` — `_add_months(d, months, eom)` renamed to `_add_months(d, months, snap_to_eom)`. The boolean now means "globally snap to EOM" (a schedule-level decision), not "snap iff this particular d is EOM". The intent is documented inline.
- `schedule.py:80` — `generate_schedule` computes `snap_to_eom = eom and start == _end_of_month(start)` exactly once before both generation paths, and passes the same flag through.
- 3 new regression tests in `test_schedule.py`: ISDA §4.10 front-stub case + multi-year cross-leap-year case + start-not-EOM no-op case.
- Full parallel suite: **11838 passed in 3:20** — zero regressions in any downstream caller.

### Affected upstream

Any bond, swap, or amortising trade whose schedule had `start = EOM` and `end != EOM`. UST issued at end-of-month with a coupon-date maturity is the prototypical case. Schedules with EOM at *both* ends (the existing `test_eom_preserved` case) were already correct; nothing breaks.

## v0.889.0 — 2026-06-11

**G1 P3 Slice 2 — schema versioning on `@serialisable`. G1 P3 complete. Gate 1 closed.**

Every serialised dict now carries an explicit schema version, giving us a hard hook for future wire-format migrations without breaking anything that exists today. Combined with G1 P1 (`CalibrationResult`), G1 P2 (`MarketSnapshot` on every calibrator), and G1 P3 Slice 1 (`NumericalConfig`), pricebook is now **audit-ready**: a price is reconstructible from a stable, dated, versioned artefact graph.

- New class attribute `_SERIAL_SCHEMA_VERSION: int = 1` on `Serialisable`, `@serialisable`, and `@serialisable_convention`. Bump in your class when you make a *breaking* wire change.
- Envelope format (`Serialisable`, `@serialisable`) gains a top-level `"schema_version"` key alongside `"type"` and `"params"`.
- Flat-convention format (`@serialisable_convention`) gains a reserved `"_schema_version"` key — underscore-prefixed so it cannot collide with any real convention field.
- `from_dict` reads the version, treats *absent* as v1 silently (existing payloads on disk continue to deserialise), and raises a clear `ValueError("...schema_version=N, but this build only supports up to M. Upgrade this environment.")` when a payload was written by a newer build.
- Decorators take an optional `schema_version=N` keyword for classes that introduce migrations: `@serialisable("irs", [...], schema_version=2)` and `@serialisable_convention("foo", schema_version=3)`.
- 24 new tests in `test_serialisable_schema_version.py`: default version, to_dict emits version (envelope + flat), round-trip across all three paths, backward compat with absent-version payloads, future-version rejection with a clear message, wire-format key invariants, and version-key strip-before-construct.
- Full parallel suite: **11835 passed in 5:34** — every existing serialisation round-trip in the library still works.

### Gate 1 closed

Phase 1: every calibrator produces a uniform `CalibrationResult` (UUID, timestamp, code version, residuals, optimiser story).
Phase 2: every calibrator accepts a `MarketSnapshot`; id links to the result.
Phase 3: numerical hyperparameters become first-class on `PricingContext`; wire format becomes version-aware.

**Result:** a price computed today can be reconstructed tomorrow from a single, structured, versioned artefact chain: trade → pricer → `PricingContext{numerical_config, curves}` → `CalibrationResult.market_snapshot_id` → `MarketSnapshot`. Each link is dated, identified, and serialisable.

Next: Gate 2 — *production-grade*. Begin auditing each module with the audit chain available.

---

## v0.888.0 — 2026-06-11

**G1 P3 Slice 1 — `NumericalConfig` + `PricingContext.numerical_config`.**

Numerical hyperparameters become first-class. Two valuations on the same book with different MC path counts are *different valuations* — until now that choice was buried in hard-coded defaults inside each pricer and invisible to any audit. After this slice the choice lives on the context and can be serialised, diffed, and overridden as a single object.

- New module `pricebook.core.numerical_config`:
  - `NumericalConfig` — frozen dataclass with 14 fields covering Monte Carlo (paths, seed, antithetic, Sobol, Brownian bridge), PDE/FD (time/space steps, truncation width), tree steps, integration (tol, max-iter), COS method (N, L), root-finding (tol, max-iter), plus an `extra: Mapping[str, Any]` escape hatch. `.replace(**kwargs)` for ergonomic edits.
  - `DEFAULT_NUMERICAL_CONFIG` — frozen, shared singleton matching the historical library defaults so no existing behaviour changes.
- `PricingContext` gains `numerical_config: NumericalConfig | None = None`. `get_numerical_config()` returns the attached config or the default singleton — pricers should read through the accessor. `.replace(numerical_config=...)` works including clearing to `None`.
- 14 new tests in `test_numerical_config.py`: frozen-ness, `.replace`, default fallback, accessor returns attached / falls back, `simple()` factory unchanged, end-to-end with curve + config.
- Purely additive — `PricingContext.simple()` and all existing call-sites are untouched.

Next slice (G1 P3 Slice 2) adds **schema versioning** on `@serialisable` — closes Gate 1.

---

## v0.887.0 — 2026-06-11

**G1 P2 Slice 5 — jump-model calibrators accept a `MarketSnapshot`. G1 P2 complete.**

The last family of calibrators wires through. **Every calibrator in pricebook now accepts an optional `market_snapshot`**, and `CalibrationResult.market_snapshot_id` is populated whenever provided — closing Phase 2 of Gate 1.

- `pricebook.models.jump_calibration.calibrate_jump_model(...)` — keyword-only `market_snapshot: MarketSnapshot | None = None`. Covers all six Lévy / jump models (Merton, VG, Kou, NIG, CGMY, Bates).
- `calibrate_jump_surface(...)` — same; a single snapshot stamps onto every per-expiry result (the typical case: one observation set underlies the whole surface).
- `TYPE_CHECKING` import — no runtime dep.
- 6 new tests in `test_jump_snapshot.py`: keyword-only enforcement, id linkage on the single-expiry path, surface-level propagation across multiple expiries (each per-expiry `CalibrationResult.id` is distinct while the `market_snapshot_id` is shared).

### G1 P2 — complete (Slices 1-5)

12 calibration entry points across 9 modules now accept a `MarketSnapshot`:

| Slice | Module | Entry points |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `pricebook.market_data` | (types only) |
| 2 | `pricebook.curves.bootstrap` / `global_solver` | `bootstrap`, `global_bootstrap` |
| 3 | `pricebook.curves.multicurve_solver` / `credit.bond_hazard_bootstrap` | `multicurve_newton`, `bootstrap_hazard_from_bonds`, `bootstrap_hazard_mixed`, `bootstrap_hazard_adaptive` |
| 4 | `pricebook.models.{hw,g2pp,lmm}_calibration` / `pricebook.options.sabr` | `calibrate_hull_white`, `calibrate_g2pp`, `calibrate_lmm_vols`, `sabr_calibrate` |
| 5 | `pricebook.models.jump_calibration` | `calibrate_jump_model`, `calibrate_jump_surface` |

Audit chain end-to-end: **price → calibration → market snapshot**. Next: **G1 P3** — `NumericalConfig` on `PricingContext` + schema versioning on `@serialisable` — closes Gate 1.

---

## v0.886.0 — 2026-06-11

**G1 P2 Slice 4 — HW, G2++, SABR, LMM calibrators accept a `MarketSnapshot`.**

Four model calibrators wired in one slice. Audit chain now reaches every IR/vol model-calibration entry point in the library.

- `pricebook.models.hw_calibration.calibrate_hull_white(...)` — keyword-only `market_snapshot: MarketSnapshot | None = None`.
- `pricebook.models.g2pp_calibration.calibrate_g2pp(...)` — same.
- `pricebook.models.lmm_calibration.calibrate_lmm_vols(...)` — same.
- `pricebook.options.sabr.sabr_calibrate(...)` — same; returned dict's `"calibration_result"` carries the linked id.
- All four use `TYPE_CHECKING` import on `pricebook.market_data.MarketSnapshot` — no runtime dep added.
- 12 new tests in `test_models_snapshot.py`: keyword-only enforcement and id linkage on each calibrator (G2++ uses `method="minimize"` to stay under a second per test).

Single slice left in G1 P2: jump-model calibrators (`calibrate_jump_model` family: Merton, VG, Kou, NIG, CGMY, Bates) — same additive pattern. After that, G1 P2 closes and G1 P3 (`NumericalConfig` on `PricingContext`) begins.

---

## v0.885.0 — 2026-06-11

**G1 P2 Slice 3 — `multicurve_newton` + the bond-hazard bootstrap family accept a `MarketSnapshot`.**

Phase 2 of Gate 1 now reaches every major curve-and-hazard calibration entry point. The audit chain **price → calibration → market snapshot** is wired through the `curves` *and* `credit` subpackages — together with G1 P2 Slice 2, this covers all single- and multi-curve bootstrapping plus credit hazard calibration.

- `pricebook.curves.multicurve_solver.multicurve_newton(...)` gains keyword-only `market_snapshot: MarketSnapshot | None = None`. Id propagates through both converged and non-converged paths (the latter still emits the existing `RuntimeWarning`). Both `ois_curve.calibration_result` and `projection_curve.calibration_result` share the same `CalibrationResult` instance, so the link is canonical, not duplicated.
- `pricebook.credit.bond_hazard_bootstrap`:
  - `bootstrap_hazard_from_bonds(...)` — keyword-only `market_snapshot`. Id threads through `_bootstrap_sequential` and `_bootstrap_global` (both reach `CalibrationResult.market_snapshot_id`).
  - `bootstrap_hazard_mixed(...)` — same.
  - `bootstrap_hazard_adaptive(...)` — same; passes the snapshot through to the chosen downstream entry point.
- `TYPE_CHECKING` import on both new touch sites — no runtime dep on `pricebook.market_data`.
- 9 new tests in `test_multicurve_snapshot.py`: keyword-only enforcement, id linkage on converged + non-converged multicurve, id linkage on sequential + global bond-hazard, snapshot-presence is numerically inert.

G1 P2 ready for Slice 4 (other model calibrators: HW, G2++, SABR, LMM, jump models — same additive pattern).

---

## v0.884.0 — 2026-06-11

**G1 P2 Slice 2 — `bootstrap` and `global_bootstrap` accept a `MarketSnapshot`; snapshot id propagates onto the `CalibrationResult`.**

Audit chain extends: **price → calibration → market snapshot** is now wired end-to-end for the two L2 entry points used by every downstream pricer.

- `pricebook.curves.bootstrap.bootstrap(...)` gains a keyword-only `market_snapshot: MarketSnapshot | None = None` parameter.
- `pricebook.curves.global_solver.global_bootstrap(...)` gains the same keyword-only parameter.
- When provided, `MarketSnapshot.id` is stamped onto `CalibrationResult.market_snapshot_id` on the curve's `calibration_result`. When absent, the field stays `None` (back-compat).
- Snapshot is a **provenance pointer** in this slice — deposits/swaps args remain authoritative for the actual rates. A future slice will let bootstrap *derive* the deposit/swap lists from the snapshot's quotes.
- 9 new tests in `test_curve_bootstrap_snapshot.py`: snapshot↔calibration linkage, keyword-only enforcement, snapshot-presence is numerically inert, distinct snapshots produce distinct results.
- `TYPE_CHECKING` import on both files — no runtime dep added to `pricebook.curves`.

---

## v0.883.0 — 2026-06-11

**G1 P2 Slice 1 — `pricebook.market_data` package + canonical L1 raw-data types.**

Phase 2 of Gate 1 begins. Where Phase 1 made every calibration produce a `CalibrationResult`, Phase 2 makes the *raw market data* a first-class, identifiable artefact — so the audit chain extends one step further: price → calibration → market snapshot.

This first slice introduces the **types only**, purely additive — nothing existing is touched.

- New package `pricebook.market_data` (L1 in the layer graph; zero dependencies on other pricebook subpackages).
- `QuoteKind` — `str`-Enum of 17 recognised quote types (deposits, FRAs, futures, swaps, basis, xccy, CDS, bond px/yield, vol points, swaption/capfloor vols, FX spot/forward, inflation YoY/ZC, other).
- `QuoteId` — frozen dataclass `(kind, tenor, currency, label)`; stable, hashable, the "same instrument across time" key.
- `Quote` — frozen `(id, value, bid_ask_bp)`; a single observation.
- `MarketSnapshot` — frozen `(id: UUID, as_of: datetime, quotes: tuple[Quote,...], label)`. `MarketSnapshot.new()` auto-generates id + timestamp. `get(qid)`, `filter(kind=, currency=, label=)`, `with_quote(q)` (returns a new snapshot with a fresh id — replaces same-id quotes). `__len__`, `__iter__`, `__contains__` for ergonomic use.
- `FixingHistory` — frozen wrapper around `{(rate_name, date) -> value}`; `get`, `for_rate`, `rate_names`, `with_fixing`. Distinct from `MarketSnapshot` (fixings are backward-looking, no bid-ask).
- 31 new tests in `test_market_data_types.py` covering frozen-ness, equality, hashing, factory behaviour, auditing invariants (fresh id on `with_quote`, original snapshot unchanged).

The existing `pricebook.core.market_data.MarketDataSnapshot` is untouched — backward compatibility is total. Subsequent slices in G1 P2 will let bootstrap/global-bootstrap accept a `MarketSnapshot` and record `MarketSnapshot.id` on the resulting `CalibrationResult.market_snapshot_id`.

---

## v0.882.0 — 2026-06-11

**G1 P1 Slice 6 — `jump_calibration` produces `CalibrationResult`. G1 P1 complete.**

The last of seven calibration families lands. With this slice, **every calibration in the codebase produces a uniform `CalibrationResult` artefact**, closing out Phase 1 of Gate 1 in the `DESIGN.md` roadmap.

- `JumpCalibrationResult` (covers all six jump/Lévy models: Merton, VG, Kou, NIG, CGMY, Bates) gains `calibration_result: CalibrationResult | None` + `to_calibration_result()` method. `to_dict` gets `calibration_id` key.
- `calibrate_jump_model` populates with `model_class=f"jump_{model_type}"` (e.g. `jump_merton`, `jump_vg`, `jump_kou`, `jump_nig`, `jump_cgmy`, `jump_bates`), parameters as the per-model param dict (4 for Merton, 3 for VG, 4 for Kou, 4 for NIG, 4 for CGMY, 7 for Bates), residuals = `model_vol − market_vol` per strike, algorithm `"differential_evolution+L-BFGS-B"`, deterministic seed recorded, spot / rate / T / div_yield / bounds in `optimiser.extra`, `rmse_vol` in diagnostics, quotes named `smile_K=<strike>`.
- 12 new tests in `test_calibration_result_jump.py`: 9 end-to-end (1 fast Merton calibration with 3 strikes / `maxiter=30`) + 3 back-compat.
- 32 tests pass across the jump family (test_jump_calibration + test_jump_cross_validation + new file) — no regression.

### G1 P1 — complete (Slices 1-6)

103 dedicated calibration-layer tests in total. **Every calibrator in pricebook now produces a `CalibrationResult`:**

| # | Family | Model class string | Algorithm |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | foundation | (none — types only) | n/a |
| 2 | bond hazard | `bond_hazard_pwc` | brentq-per-bond / L-BFGS-B[+tikhonov] |
| 3 | Hull-White | `hull_white` | Nelder-Mead / DE / L-BFGS-B |
| 3 | G2++ | `g2pp` | differential_evolution+L-BFGS-B |
| 4 | LMM | `lmm` | iterative_scaling |
| 4 | SABR | `sabr` | nelder_mead |
| 5 | curve bootstrap | `discount_curve_bootstrap` | brentq-sequential |
| 5 | global curve | `discount_curve_global` | newton-global |
| 5 | multicurve | `multicurve` | newton-multicurve |
| 6 | jump (6 models) | `jump_{merton,vg,kou,nig,cgmy,bates}` | differential_evolution+L-BFGS-B |

The audit trail `(price) -> (calibration_id) -> (market_snapshot, code_version, optimiser)` is now reconstructable end-to-end for every calibrated number in pricebook.

Next phase: **G1 P2** — `MarketSnapshot` at L1, the canonical raw-market-data type. Curves will be built from snapshots; the `market_snapshot_id` field on `CalibrationResult` (currently always `None`) will be populated.

---

## v0.881.0 — 2026-06-11

**G1 P1 Slice 5 — curve bootstrap produces `CalibrationResult`.**

The highest-fan-out calibration in the codebase: nearly every pricing call traces back to a bootstrapped discount curve. Six of seven calibration families now carry the canonical artefact (bond hazard, Hull-White, G2++, LMM, SABR, **curve bootstrap**); jump calibration is the last one (Slice 6).

- **`DiscountCurve.calibration_result: CalibrationResult | None`** — new instance attribute on the L0 curve class itself. Defaults to `None` for curves built directly (`flat(...)`, manual pillar construction); set to the canonical artefact by bootstrap entry points. Type hinted under `TYPE_CHECKING` to avoid a runtime import cycle between `core` and `calibration`.
- **`curves.bootstrap.bootstrap()`** — sequential brentq-per-pillar bootstrap now constructs a `CalibrationResult` after the round-trip verification step and attaches it to the returned curve. `model_class="discount_curve_bootstrap"`, algorithm `"brentq-sequential"`, residuals = (model_rate − market_rate) per instrument (deposits, FRAs, futures) or (PV_fixed − PV_float) per swap, parameters keyed by pillar date as `df(YYYY-MM-DD)`. RMS residual ~1e-14 (machine precision, exact fit by construction).
- **`curves.global_solver.global_bootstrap()`** — Newton-global simultaneous solve. Residuals are the final per-instrument repricing errors; algorithm `"newton-global"`, `tol` and `max_iter` passed through to `OptimiserSpec`. Converged flag captures whether the Newton loop hit `tol` before `max_iter`.
- **`curves.multicurve_solver.multicurve_newton()`** — joint OIS + projection calibration. Both `MultiCurveResult.calibration_result` AND `ois_curve.calibration_result` AND `projection_curve.calibration_result` get the SAME `CalibrationResult` instance (they share the calibration). Parameters carry an `ois_df(...)` / `proj_df(...)` prefix to distinguish the two pillar sets. `MultiCurveResult` gains a `to_calibration_result()` method that returns the stored instance or builds on-demand.
- 17 new tests in `test_calibration_result_curve_bootstrap.py`: default-None on `DiscountCurve.flat`, populated by `bootstrap()` / `global_bootstrap()` / `multicurve_newton()`, residual sanity (machine precision for sequential, sub-tol for Newton), parameter naming, quote naming, unique-id-per-call, multicurve cross-attachment, back-compat for hand-constructed `MultiCurveResult`.
- 40 tests pass across the full curve family (bootstrap + global_solver + multicurve_solver + new Slice 5 tests) — no regression.
- `coupled_bootstrap` and `bootstrap_forward_curve` not migrated in this slice — deferred to Slice 5b if needed.

Next: Slice 6 covers `jump_calibration` — the last calibration family.

---

## v0.880.0 — 2026-06-11

**G1 P1 Slice 4 — LMM + SABR calibration produce `CalibrationResult`.**

Five of seven calibration families now produce the canonical artefact (bond hazard, Hull-White, G2++, LMM, SABR). Two remaining: curve bootstrap (Slice 5) and jump calibration (Slice 6).

- `LMMCalibrationResult` (dataclass) gains `calibration_result: CalibrationResult | None` field + `to_calibration_result()` method. `to_dict` gets `calibration_id` key.
- `calibrate_lmm_vols` populates with `model_class="lmm"`, parameters as `{"sigma_0", ..., "sigma_{n-1}"}` (one per forward rate), residuals in vol units (`fitted - target` per swaption), algorithm `"iterative_scaling"`, `correlation_beta` and `tau` recorded in `optimiser.extra`, `rmse_vol` in diagnostics.
- `sabr.sabr_calibrate` (dict-returning, by convention) gains a `"calibration_result"` key in its returned dict — additive, no existing key removed or renamed.
- SABR `CalibrationResult` has `model_class="sabr"`, parameters `{"alpha", "beta", "rho", "nu"}` (4 params), residuals as `model_vol − market_vol` per strike (vol units, not bp), algorithm `"nelder_mead"`, `forward` / `T` / `beta_fixed` in `optimiser.extra`, quotes named `smile_K=<strike>`. `calibrate_sabr_smile` inherits the dict unchanged.
- 21 new tests in `test_calibration_result_lmm_sabr.py`: 9 LMM end-to-end + 3 LMM back-compat + 9 SABR end-to-end (existing keys preserved, parameters / residuals / quotes / unique ids).
- 64 tests pass across LMM + SABR family (test_sabr.py + test_lmm.py + test_lmm_calibration.py + new file) — no regression.

Next: Slice 5 migrates curve bootstrap (`curves.bootstrap`, `curves.multicurve_solver`, `curves.global_solver`) to produce `CalibrationResult`. The curve bootstrap is the highest-fan-out calibration in the codebase — many tests will see the new field downstream.

---

## v0.879.0 — 2026-06-11

**G1 P1 Slice 3 — `g2pp_calibration` and `hw_calibration` produce `CalibrationResult`.**

Same template as Slice 2, applied to the two single-curve rate-model calibrations. Three of the seven calibration families in `pricebook` now produce the canonical artefact (bond hazard, Hull-White, G2++); LMM, SABR, jump, and curve bootstrap follow in Slices 4-6.

- `HWCalibrationResult` gains `calibration_result: CalibrationResult | None` field and a `to_calibration_result()` method that returns the stored instance when populated or builds on-demand otherwise. `to_dict` gets the `calibration_id` key.
- `calibrate_hull_white` populates `calibration_result` with `model_class="hull_white"`, parameters `{"a": ..., "sigma": ...}`, residuals in vol-bp, `OptimiserSpec(algorithm=...)` capturing the chosen optimiser (`Nelder-Mead`, `differential_evolution`, or `L-BFGS-B`), `rmse_vol` in diagnostics, and `n_steps` in optimiser.extra.
- `G2PPCalibrationResult` gains the same field and method. `to_dict` gets the `calibration_id` key.
- `calibrate_g2pp` populates with `model_class="g2pp"`, parameters `{"a", "b", "sigma1", "sigma2", "rho"}` (5 params), residuals in vol-bp, algorithm `"differential_evolution+L-BFGS-B"` (or `"L-BFGS-B"` for minimise method), and the parameter bounds in `optimiser.extra`. Seed=42 recorded when DE is used.
- 16 new tests in `test_calibration_result_g2pp_hw.py`:
  - 9 HW tests run the full `calibrate_hull_white` on a small 3-swaption grid (~3 sec each): population of all fields, optimiser name and extras, residuals match `per_swaption_errors`, rmse_vol in diagnostics, named quote IDs, `to_calibration_result()` returns stored instance, unique id per run, `calibration_id` in `to_dict`.
  - 7 G2++ tests via hand-constructed `G2PPCalibrationResult` (the slow full `calibrate_g2pp` is covered by existing tests in `test_g2pp_calibration.py` which are deselected in CI): on-demand `to_calibration_result()` path, parameters count (5), `calibration_id` in `to_dict` both populated and unpopulated paths.
- Zero behavior change to existing tests (24 HW + Slice 3 tests pass; existing G2++ tests untouched).

Next: Slice 4 migrates `lmm_calibration` and `sabr` calibration to the same pattern.

## v0.878.0 — 2026-06-11

**G1 P1 Slice 2 — `bond_hazard_bootstrap` now produces a `CalibrationResult`.**

First migration of an existing calibration to the new canonical artefact (DESIGN.md §6 G1 P1). The bond-hazard bootstrap was chosen because it is the most recently touched calibration (Tikhonov + L-curve work landed yesterday) and its results carry the richest provenance (`lam`, `roughness`, per-bond residuals).

- `HazardBootstrapResult` gains a `calibration_result: CalibrationResult | None` field. Defaults to `None` for backward compatibility with hand-constructed instances; entry points always populate it.
- `_bootstrap_sequential` populates a `CalibrationResult` with `model_class="bond_hazard_pwc"`, `objective=SSE`, `optimiser=OptimiserSpec(algorithm="brentq-per-bond", ...)`, one iteration per bond, per-bond weights.
- `_bootstrap_global` populates with `objective=WEIGHTED_SSE`, `optimiser=OptimiserSpec(algorithm="L-BFGS-B[+tikhonov(lam=...)]", ...)`. When `lam > 0`: `lam` recorded in `optimiser.extra`, `roughness` in `diagnostics.extra`. Algorithm name gets the `+tikhonov(lam=...)` suffix for quick filtering in audit logs.
- `bootstrap_hazard_mixed` (FRN + bond joint fit) also migrated; `quotes_fitted` carries `["bond_0", ..., "frn_0", ...]`.
- New `to_calibration_result()` method returns the stored instance when populated, or builds one on-demand from the existing fields when not. Latter path covers any legacy hand-construction.
- `to_dict()` gets a `calibration_id` key (the UUID stringified, or `None`). Lets persistence layers later use this as a foreign key.
- 15 new tests in `test_bond_hazard_calibration_result.py` — population, parameter/residual/weight matching, Tikhonov-extras, unique id per invocation, on-demand build, hand-construction back-compat, `calibration_id` in dict.

Zero existing test changes: the `rmse_bp`, `pillar_hazards`, and other historical API surface is preserved. The new `calibration_result` is purely additive.

Next: Slice 3 migrates `g2pp_calibration` and `hw_calibration` to produce `CalibrationResult` (same template).

---

## v0.877.0 — 2026-06-11

**G1 P1 Slice 1 — `pricebook.calibration` skeleton + `CalibrationResult` + `Calibrator` Protocol.**

First slice of Gate 1 from `DESIGN.md` §6. The calibration layer gets its own package; the canonical result type is defined here so that subsequent slices can migrate each existing calibrator family (bond hazard, G2++, Hull-White, LMM, SABR, curve bootstrap, multicurve) to produce a uniform `CalibrationResult`.

- New package `python/pricebook/calibration/`:
  - `__init__.py` — public exports.
  - `_types.py` — `CalibrationResult` (frozen dataclass with `id`, `timestamp`, `code_version`, `model_class`, `parameters`, `residuals`, `rms_residual`, `max_residual`, `optimiser`, `iterations`, `converged`, `diagnostics`, `market_snapshot_id`), `OptimiserSpec`, `CalibrationDiagnostics`, `ObjectiveKind` (SSE / weighted-SSE / RMSE / max-error / L1 / Huber), `Calibrator` Protocol.
  - `CalibrationResult.new(...)` factory — keyword-only, auto-generates `id` and `timestamp`, derives `rms_residual` and `max_residual` from `residuals`, reads `pricebook.__version__` for `code_version` by default.
- 22 tests in `tests/test_calibration_types.py` covering enum values, OptimiserSpec construction & frozen-ness, diagnostics defaults & population, factory derivation of RMSE/max-error, default weights, explicit weights, code_version detection & override, market_snapshot_id placeholder, frozen-ness at all levels, Protocol satisfaction.
- Zero internal pricebook imports (other than `pricebook.__version__` read defensively) — package sits cleanly in the dependency graph; no behavior change to any existing code.

This slice is purely additive: no existing module is touched. Slice 2 migrates `bond_hazard_bootstrap` to return the new result type with a thin compatibility wrapper preserving the existing `HazardBootstrapResult` interface.

---

## v0.876.0 — 2026-06-11

**`DESIGN.md` — §6 roadmap rewritten as Gate × Phase hybrid.**

- Old roadmap had 4 phases with significant overlap (CalibrationResult in P1, calibration layer in P2 — same effort, separate commits) and blurry themes ("foundational types" + "structural relocation"). Phase 2 was 20-27 slices bundling six different efforts.
- New structure: **5 gates** (each a user-visible promise) × **10 phases** (each one architectural focus):
  - **G1 Audit-ready** — P1 Calibration unified + P2 Market data L1 + P3 NumericalConfig & versioning (14-16 slices, 1-3 weeks). Prerequisite for the bottom-up audit.
  - **G2 Production-grade** — P4 Scenarios & failures + P5 Repositories & per-layer tests (7-9 slices).
  - **G3 Architecturally clean** — P6 small cleanups + P7 Risk relocation L3→L7 isolated (9-13 slices). P7 is the biggest single refactor; isolated so it doesn't poison its gate.
  - **G4 Capability-complete** — P8 AAD as protocol + P9 Payoff algebra (10-13 slices).
  - **G5 Performant at scale** — P10 C++ port (19-28 slices, open-ended).
  - Total: **59-79 slices, 7-19 weeks** at the historical pricebook slice rate.
- Each gate is shippable independently. G2 doesn't require G3; you can stop after G2 and have a meaningfully better library.
- Section now includes a per-gate exit criteria, a dependency graph between phases, and "the first three slices of G1 P1" so the immediate next step after acceptance is unambiguous.
- Executive summary + TOC updated to reflect the new structure.

---

## v0.875.0 — 2026-06-11

**`DESIGN.md` — theoretical design document (~30 pages).**

- New `DESIGN.md` at the repo root: a first-principles design of a financial analytics engine, then pricebook overlaid as the lens.
- Sections 1-3 (principles, reference architecture, patterns/anti-patterns) drafted by `app-designer` for an independent second perspective on architecture; sections 4-6 written here.
- The reference design: 9-layer architecture with **calibration as its own layer (L6)**, parallel to risk, both depending on pricing (L5). **Models as `Protocol`, not inheritance.** **Trades as frozen dataclasses, market state passed in via `PricingContext`**. AAD via generic-scalar discipline at L0. Industry references woven through (QuantLib, ORE, OpenGamma Strata, Numerix). Concrete proposed shapes for `PricingContext`, `CalibrationResult`, `RiskRun`, `Scenario`.
- Pricebook gap analysis (§4): the architecture matches the reference at the foundations (acyclic layering, `PricingContext` exists, serialisation contract, mostly-Protocol models, mostly-frozen dataclasses), but diverges in three structural places: **risk at L3 instead of L6 above pricing** (the biggest mismatch — forces risk modules to know about concrete instruments); **calibration distributed rather than its own layer** (no unified `CalibrationResult`); **market data conflated with curves** (cannot distinguish quotes from fits in the dependency graph).
- Delta list (§5): 6 high-value adds (CalibrationResult, MarketSnapshot, Scenario protocol, PricingFailure, NumericalConfig, schema versioning), 5 wrong-shape refactors (risk relocation, calibration consolidation, market data split, pe/ relocation, registry consolidation), 4 nice-to-haves, 5 explicit won't-fixes.
- Roadmap (§6): 4 phases, **~63-84 slices total, ~10-22 weeks at the historical slice rate**. Phase 1 (foundational types) is the prerequisite for the bottom-up audit (the next major task after this document is accepted).

Status: ready for pushback before the bottom-up audit begins. Sections 1-3 are load-bearing — everything in 4-6 depends on the layer cut and the calibration placement.

---

## v0.874.0 — 2026-06-11

**Hazard-from-bonds notebook — adapted to use the library Tikhonov.**

- Removed the ad-hoc `regularised_bootstrap(...)` function from the notebook builder (Section 5). Replaced its 5 call sites (λ-sweep, L-curve dense grid, LOO-CV inner loop, MC sensitivity, realistic demo) with `bootstrap_hazard_from_bonds(method="global", pillar_times=..., lam=...)`. Section 9's `res_tik` is now a `HazardBootstrapResult`, with downstream code reading attributes (`res_tik.pillar_hazards`, `res_tik.survival_curve`) instead of dict keys.
- Updated Section 5 prose to point users at the library API; replaced the closing cheat sheet's "not currently in library" caveat with the recommended call (`lam="auto"`, `pillar_times=[...]`).
- Notebook re-executes cleanly: 46 cells (down from 47 — one builder-cell removed), 0 errors, 14 embedded plots. Every headline number unchanged (L-curve λ* = 3.16e+06, LOO-CV λ* = 6.58e+06, Section-10 Q(5y) MC mean 0.8867 vs deterministic 0.8877) — the library-backed and ad-hoc fits agree to numerics.
- The notebook is now self-consistent with the library: a reader who sees the API in §5 can apply it directly in their own code with no further translation.

Closes the Tikhonov work started in v0.872. Two-slice pattern (library first, notebook after) preserved.

---

## v0.873.0 — 2026-06-11

**`pillar_times` override in `bond_hazard_bootstrap`.**

- `_bootstrap_global`, `bootstrap_hazard_from_bonds`, and `find_lcurve_lambda` all gain an optional `pillar_times: list[float] | None = None` parameter. When provided, it overrides the default even-spacing of pillars and `n_pillars` is ignored.
- Two common patterns this enables:
  - **Pillars at bond maturities** (exactly-determined fit at `lam=0`, regularised as `lam` grows) — useful when the bond universe has natural calibration anchors at the cashflow dates.
  - **Pillars at calendar benchmarks** (e.g. 1, 2, 5, 10, 30y for sovereign) — for curves that need to align with peer-group benchmarks.
- Validation: empty list, non-positive values, and non-strictly-increasing sequences all raise `ValueError`.
- 4 new tests in `test_bond_hazard_tikhonov.py::TestPillarTimes` covering override behaviour, exact-fit-at-bond-maturities semantics, validation errors, and combination with `lam="auto"`. Brings the new test count to **15**.
- Required for the hazard-from-bonds notebook to be adaptable to the library API (Slice B); the existing notebook's `regularised_bootstrap` placed pillars at bond maturities to make the close-pair pedagogy clean.

---

## v0.872.0 — 2026-06-11

**Tikhonov regularisation in `bond_hazard_bootstrap`.**

- `_bootstrap_global(...)` and `bootstrap_hazard_from_bonds(...)` gain a `lam` parameter:
  - `lam=0.0` (default): unregularised LS — bit-for-bit identical to the existing behaviour (regression-tested).
  - `lam > 0`: penalised LS with a second-difference (curvature) penalty $\lambda\|Lh\|^2$.
  - `lam="auto"`: pick λ via the L-curve corner (Hansen 1992).
- New helper `find_lcurve_lambda(...)` does the L-curve sweep + corner detection. Uses signed curvature (most-negative κ in log-log space) rather than max-|κ| to avoid boundary finite-difference artifacts.
- `HazardBootstrapResult` gains two new diagnostic fields with defaults: `lam` (the λ used) and `roughness` (the final $\|Lh\|^2$). Backward-compatible — existing constructors omitting these still work.
- Method label becomes `"global_ls_tikhonov"` when `lam > 0`, stays `"global_ls"` when `lam=0`.
- 11 new tests in `tests/test_bond_hazard_tikhonov.py`: regression at `lam=0`, monotonic roughness decrease with `lam`, `lam→∞` driving the curve to linear (zero curvature), L-curve picker correctness, edge cases (n_pillars < 3 ignores `lam`, negative `lam` raises, sequential method unaffected by `lam`).
- Doc updates: `bootstrap_hazard_from_bonds` docstring now points to the hazard-from-bonds notebook for the full derivation and L-curve picking.

The recommended call for non-trivial bond universes (any pair within ~3 months of maturity, or > 8 bonds) is now:
```python
result = bootstrap_hazard_from_bonds(
    REF, bonds, rf_curve, method="global", n_pillars=..., lam="auto"
)
```
For well-spaced 3-8 bond universes, `method="sequential"` (default via `"auto"`) remains the right answer.

---

## v0.871.0 — 2026-06-11

**Hazard-from-bonds notebook — Round 5 (final polish). Notebook now complete.**

- Added an **executive-summary table** at the top: noise amplification (27× at 1mo, 54× at 2wk), Tikhonov variance reduction (22× at the close pillar), L-curve and LOO-CV agreement (~2×), Q(5y) integrated-vs-instantaneous (matches to 0.001).
- Added the **three things to remember** rules (bootstrap brittle, Tikhonov fixes it, bond prices are integral probes).
- Added a **table of contents** with anchor links to all 10 sections + the closing cheat sheet.
- Added a closing **"When to use what" cheat sheet** — universe-shape → recommended method, three rules of thumb, plus the relevant pricebook imports.
- Added explicit `<a id="section-N"></a>` anchors before each `## N.` heading so the ToC links resolve reliably in Jupyter/nbconvert.
- Final re-execution: **47 cells (22 md + 25 code), 0 errors, 14 embedded plots, 11/11 anchored headings**.

The notebook is now content-complete and ready to publish.

---

## v0.870.0 — 2026-06-10

**Hazard-from-bonds notebook — Round 4 (sections 8-10). Notebook now complete content-wise (46 cells, ~2 MB).**

- **Section 8 (adaptive switch).** `assess_liquidity` + `bootstrap_hazard_adaptive` demo across three scenarios — liquid (6 well-spaced bonds, tight bid-ask) → `sequential`; semi-liquid (5 bonds with close pair) → `global`; illiquid (2 distressed bonds, 250-350 bp spread) → `global` with 2 pillars. Includes the important caveat that the heuristic protects against scale problems (count, spread) but **not** geometry (close maturities) — the user must reach for `method="global"` explicitly when bonds bunch.
- **Section 9 (realistic demo).** 8 bonds at sovereign-like maturities (0.5/1/3/5/5.25/7/10/10.5y) with two adjacent benchmark pairs. ±5 bp uniform price noise. Three methods side by side: sequential RMSE 0 bp (exact, brittle at close pairs), global LS RMSE 7.3 bp (5 even pillars), Tikhonov RMSE 6.3 bp (8 pillars + smoothness). Side-by-side hazard curves and per-bond residual scatter.
- **Section 10 (CIR++ cross-check — the deepest takeaway).** `CIRPlusPlus.from_survival_curve` overlays Cox-Ingersoll-Ross dynamics on the regularised piecewise-constant curve. 60 MC paths shown. **Sanity check at T=5y: deterministic Q(5) = 0.8877, MC mean Q(5) = 0.8867, MC std Q(5) = 0.0091.** The instantaneous hazard paths spread visibly around the mean, but the *integrated* survival at the bond maturities reconverges almost exactly. Geometrically: bond data constrains $\int_0^{t_i} h\,du$ at coupon dates, not $h(t)$ pointwise. Two hazard functions with the same integrals at every bond maturity are indistinguishable by bond prices. Choosing among them (piecewise constant / spline / CIR++) is a choice of *prior*, not of *data*.
- Final user-facing summary table in Section 10 markdown: when to use sequential / global / Tikhonov / CIR++.

Round 5 (final polish + ToC + commit) to follow.

---

## v0.869.0 — 2026-06-10

**Hazard-from-bonds notebook — Round 3 (sections 6-7).**

- Section 6 (Picking λ) — L-curve method (Hansen 1992) with explicit max-curvature corner detection on the log-log plot; LOO-CV (model-free GCV analogue, $N$ refits per λ point). L-curve corner λ* = 3.2e+06; LOO-CV minimum λ* = 6.6e+06 — both methods agree on regularisation strength within a factor of ~2. Two plots (L-curve with corner star; LOO-CV vs λ with both criteria's λ marked).
- Section 7 (Bid-ask sensitivity) — 200 Monte-Carlo draws with ±10 bp price half-spread (typical IG-corporate width). Box plot per pillar, unregularised vs Tikhonov at L-curve-corner λ. The headline: at the 5y+2mo close-maturity pillar, hazard standard deviation collapses from **109.3 bp (unregularised) to 4.9 bp (regularised) — a 22× variance reduction**. Other pillars (1y, 3y, 5y, 10y) see modest 1.2-1.7× reductions. Discusses the bias-vs-variance tradeoff implicit in the prior.

Now 33 cells, 898 KB. Sections 8-10 (adaptive switch, realistic demo, CIR++ cross-check) to follow.

---

## v0.868.0 — 2026-06-10

**Hazard-from-bonds notebook — Round 2 (sections 4-5).**

- Section 4 (Solver limits) — brentq bracket failure (bond above risk-free benchmark → no non-negative hazard solves it; residual stays one-signed across the whole [1e-6, 5.0] bracket) and Newton sensitivity (from h0=0.5/2/5 Newton "converges" to fake roots at the initial guess because the function is near-flat).
- Section 5 (Tikhonov theory + implementation) — full derivation of penalised least-squares: misfit + λ‖Lh‖², L = second-difference matrix. MAP interpretation: λ = 1/τ² under Gaussian prior on hazard curvature. Ad-hoc `regularised_bootstrap(...)` function defined inside the notebook (per the user's "no new code unless needed" preference — this is a teaching demonstration).
- Smoke test sweeps λ from 0 → 1e10. With +5 bp noise on the 5y bond: λ=0 reproduces the noise-amplified sequential result (rmse=0, roughness=160e-6); λ=1e6 trades 2 bp rmse for half the roughness; λ=1e8 collapses to nearly flat. Sets up Section 6 (L-curve corner picking).

Now 23 cells, 229 KB.

---

## v0.867.0 — 2026-06-10

**Hazard-from-bonds notebook — Round 1 (sections 1-3).**

- New `notebooks/credit/hazard_from_bonds_when_maturities_are_close.ipynb` (15 cells, 206 KB). Sections 1-3 of a planned 10-section walkthrough.
- Section 1: the problem setup, math derivation of the risky-bond price as a function of $h(t)$, why "close maturities" is the trouble case (Jacobian goes ill-conditioned).
- Section 2: the easy case — 4 bonds at 1/3/5/10y, sequential bootstrap reproduces input prices to machine precision (RMSE 1e-10 bp), implied hazards recover the truth's piecewise-constant shape correctly across the bond pillars (with a clean explanation of why a bond pillar that straddles two truth pillars gets the time-weighted blend, not either endpoint).
- Section 3: the dramatic failure — same 4 bonds + a 5th bond two months from the 5y. Noise-free input still works; **add 5 bp of price noise on the 5y bond and the [5y, 5y+2mo] hazard jumps by 67 bp (13× amplification)**. Sweep over $\Delta T$ from 12 months down to 2 weeks shows the amplification climb monotonically: 27× at 1-month spacing, 54× at 2-week spacing. Plotted log-log.
- Companion builder script `_build_hazard_notebook.py` — same `nbformat` + `nbconvert` pattern as `quickstart`.
- Rounds 2-5 to come: solver-limit detail (Newton + brentq failure modes), Tikhonov derivation, L-curve picking, bid-ask Monte Carlo, adaptive switch, realistic demo, stochastic-intensity cross-check.

---

## v0.866.0 — 2026-06-10

**Foundation audit: dual-critic pass on 35 modules.**

- New `MODULE_HEALTH.md` (110 KB) — adversarial audit of 35 foundation + Top-6-instrument modules. Each module reviewed by `numerical-critic` (math correctness, edge cases, calibration robustness) and `code-correctness-critic` (off-by-one, lifetime, None handling, exception safety) in parallel via the multi-agent workflow harness.
- 70 critic verdicts, 697 raw findings: **56 critical**, **150 high**, 257 medium, 217 low, 17 nit.
- **Tier 1 (both critics → critical, fuzzy-matched on title/location): 13.** Highest-confidence likely real bugs. Tier 2 (critical + high pairing): 18. Single-critic critical: 19.
- Report includes: how-to-read disclaimer, per-tier breakdowns, per-module narrative verdicts (verbatim from critics), risk-scored module ranking, recommended triage workflow. **Critic output is NOT verified bugs — each finding needs a failing-test verification slice before fixing.**
- Raw JSON output (697 findings, ~720 KB) at `/private/tmp/claude-501/.../tasks/www7hfs2m.output`.

---

## v0.865.0 — 2026-06-10

**Refresh `ARCHITECTURE.md` to match empirical state.**

- `ARCHITECTURE.md`: rewrite from scratch using a freshly-computed import graph. Previous numbers (20 sub-packages, 486 modules, 9 layers) were ~60% stale. New numbers — **23 packages, 793 modules, 7 layers** — match what `mypy`/`pytest`/`grep` see today.
- New content: per-package fan-in table, tallest path through the DAG (7 hops: `core → curves → models → fixed_income → options → fx → desks`), `crypto` and `data` packages (added since the previous revision), reorganised numerics / models / risk module catalogues to cover modules built across the last 200+ commits.
- Embedded regen snippet at the end of the document — `cd python && python <<PY ... PY` — so the file's stats can be verified on any commit instead of drifting silently.
- Companion to slices v0.863 (untangle fi → credit) and v0.864 (drop binomial_jr_lr) — without those two the layer count would be 8 instead of 7.

---

## v0.864.0 — 2026-06-10

**Remove loose top-level `binomial_jr_lr.py`.**

- Deleted `python/pricebook/binomial_jr_lr.py` — a 190-line file sitting outside any subpackage. It was unreferenced anywhere in the repo, broken at import time (`from pricebook.black76 import OptionType` — that module path doesn't exist; Black-76 lives at `pricebook.models.black76`), and the JR / LR tree implementations are already provided by `numerical/_trees.py` and registered in `registry.py` (`TreeMethod.JR`, `TreeMethod.LR`). The file was a relic of an earlier shim cleanup (see v0.4xx release notes).
- Net: 25 → 24 top-level packages/modules in `pricebook/`. The top of the tree now contains only the registered subpackages plus `__init__.py` and `registry.py`.

---

## v0.863.0 — 2026-06-10

**Untangle `fixed_income → credit` runtime edge.**

- `fixed_income/basis_trade.py`: move `from pricebook.credit.cds import CDS` into `TYPE_CHECKING`. CDS was only used as a parameter annotation (`cds: CDS`) — never instantiated or isinstance-checked. `from __future__ import annotations` was already present, so all hints are strings at runtime.
- Result: `fixed_income` now depends only on `core, curves, models, statistics` at runtime — empirical Layer 4 → Layer 3 cleanup (one whole layer down). Empirical dependency graph regenerates without the `fi → credit` edge.

---

## v0.862.0 — 2026-06-10

**Mypy: clean baseline, 0 errors.**

- `python/pyproject.toml`: complete `[tool.mypy]` config with pragmatic defaults (silence `misc`, `annotation-unchecked`, `warn_return_any` — numpy/scipy noise) plus `[[tool.mypy.overrides]]` listing 184 legacy modules with `ignore_errors = true`. `mypy>=2.0` added to `[project.optional-dependencies] dev`.
- Fixed 31 real `name-defined` errors across 12 files — missing imports for forward-referenced types (`date`, `DiscountCurve`, `Calendar`, `RepoBook`, `RFRFutureSpec`, `PricingContext`, `TotalXVAResult`, `timedelta`, `CommodityForwardCurve`). Added proper `if TYPE_CHECKING:` blocks.
- `GUIDE.md` §17: new section documenting mypy usage and the cleanup ladder (remove a module from the override list → fix surfaced errors → repeat).
- Result: `cd python && mypy pricebook` exits 0 across 795 source files. Future slices can shrink the 184-module override list toward zero.

---

## v0.861.0 — 2026-06-09

**G2++ calibration: 8.5× faster.**

- `models/g2pp_calibration.calibrate_g2pp`: rewrite the calibration objective to compare **prices** to precomputed Black-76 market prices, rather than implied vols. Eliminates an implied-vol root-finder per swaption per DE evaluation (~50% of the original cost).
- `models/g2pp_calibration.calibrate_g2pp`: loosen the global-search budget — `differential_evolution(maxiter=30, popsize=6, tol=1e-4, init="sobol")` followed by an L-BFGS-B polish at `maxiter=150, ftol=1e-9`. Previous (`maxiter=300, popsize=15, tol=1e-9`) ran the full DE budget on the default fixture without measurable RMSE improvement.
- Net: `test_g2pp_calibration.py` runs in **2:15** instead of **9:49** (full file, 8 tests). One `calibrate_g2pp(curve, SWAPTION_VOLS)` call drops from ~587 s to ~68 s. Final calibrated `rmse_vol` remains well under the 5% threshold (~0.009 on the default fixture; both tests pass).

---

## v0.860.0 — 2026-06-09

**`GUIDE.md` — per-layer API reference.**

- `GUIDE.md` (new, 17 sections, ~480 lines): curves, models, numerical methods, fixed income, FX, equity, credit, commodity, options, structured, crypto, desks, risk, viz, serialisation, conventions, db/ts. 180 module references verified to exist. Includes runnable code snippets at each layer.
- `README.md`: link to `GUIDE.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `RELEASE_NOTES.md`, and the quickstart notebook. Now an actual landing page rather than a stub.

---

## v0.859.0 — 2026-06-09

**Quickstart notebook.**

- `notebooks/examples/quickstart.ipynb`: 20-minute "first result" walkthrough — curve bootstrap, bond pricing, IRS pricing, equity option pricing + Greeks, `to_dict`/`from_dict` round-trip, curve plot + Greeks profile via `pricebook.viz`. All 8 code cells executed and embedded.
- `notebooks/examples/_build_quickstart.py`: deterministic builder script for the notebook (nbformat-based) so future edits land via Python, not JSON.

---

## v0.858.0 — 2026-06-09

**Serialisation completeness — money market + funded products.**

- `fixed_income/money_market.py`: register `CertificateOfDeposit`, `CommercialPaper`, `BankersAcceptance` as `_serialisable`. `RepoRate` is a static-method namespace, no instance state — left unregistered.
- `fixed_income/funded.py`: register `TotalReturnSwap` (as `funded_trs`) and `FundedParticipation`. The other 3 classes (`Repo`, `ReverseRepo`, `RepoFinancedPosition`) were already registered.
- `funded.TotalReturnSwap`: rename internal attrs `ref_start`/`ref_current` → `reference_pv_start`/`reference_pv_current` so they match constructor params (required for `_serialisable`). Only used inside `funded.py`; tests already pass via init kwargs.

**Yield curve bootstrapping from bond prices alone.**

- New `curves/bond_curve.py`:

  - `bootstrap_curve_from_bonds()` — unified entry point with 4 methods:
    - `"sequential"` — exact fit, one bond per pillar (like CDS bootstrap but for DFs).
    - `"global"` — least-squares, robust to noise, supports n_pillars < n_bonds.
    - `"nelson_siegel"` — 4-parameter smooth curve fitted directly to bond prices (not zero rates).
    - `"svensson"` — 6-parameter smooth curve (captures humps better than NS).
    - `"auto"` — sequential if ≤8 distinct maturities, else global.

- **Barrier bridge**: fixed bridge_min formula for down-and-out/down-and-in — now uses correct conditional probability `P(min < b) = exp(-2(s0-b)(s1-b)/(σ²dt))` instead of incorrect `s0 + s1 - max` approximation.
- **Non-Gaussian copula**: systematic factor M now uses `sample_with_factor()` for Gaussian copula (correct), and independent fallback for non-Gaussian (honest about limitation, was previously using meaningless Z.mean approximation).
- **OU exact step**: added `dt < 1e-14` guard to prevent `dw/sqrt(dt)` numerical instability.
- **BMA**: None AIC/BIC now gets mean IC of other models (was 0.0, which gave infinite weight).

- `apply_theme` is an internal context manager in `viz/_backend.py`, not part of the public API. `configure_theme()` at the top of each notebook sets the theme globally.
- 10,088 tests pass.

---

## v0.652.0 — 2026-05-30

**Fix all moderate audit issues — input validation, magic number docs, edge case guards.**

- `network_xva.py`: exposure matrix shape validation (N,N), capital buffers shape (N,), recovery in [0,1].
- `calibration_quality.py`: array length mismatch check, n < 1 guard in `calibration_entropy`, n < 2 guard + n_params validation in `model_comparison`.
- `composite_convention.py`: `__post_init__` validates haircut ∈ [0,1] and recovery ∈ [0,1].

---

## v0.651.0 — 2026-05-30

**Code audit fixes — 3 critical issues from 11-lens audit.**

- Fixed `credit_leveraged.py` line 131: `effective_leverage = min(leverage, 1.0 / 1e-10)` was a no-op (1e10 cap). Changed to direct assignment — leverage applies directly to digital CLN loss.
- Fixed `regime_pricing.py`: all `probs / probs.sum()` calls now validate `sum > 0` before dividing. Raises `ValueError` on zero-sum regime probabilities instead of silently producing NaN.
- Fixed `cds_bond_basis.py`: `bond_implied_cds_spread()` now validates bracket `f(0) × f(2) < 0` before calling brentq. Raises informative `ValueError` if market price is outside feasible range.
- Audit covered 9 files (6 new, 3 modified), 10 quality dimensions.
- 10,043 tests pass.

---

---

## v0.647.0 — 2026-05-30

**Build 2 missing capabilities for paper validation.**

- New `bond_implied_cds_spread()` in `credit/cds_bond_basis.py` — solves for flat hazard rate that reprices a risky bond at its market price, then converts to CDS spread. Enables Zhou Table 1 reproduction.
- `CMCDSResult.participation_rate` field added in `credit/credit_leveraged.py` — φ = fair_spread / forward_spread. Enables Brigo-Morini participation rate validation.
- **Backward compat:** Both additive. CMCDSResult has new field with default 0.0.
- 10,004 tests pass.

---

## v0.646.0 — 2026-05-30

**Chunk 3 complete: Papers 9-12. All 12 papers validated. 10,004 tests.**

---

## v0.642.0 — 2026-05-29

**Paper 1 validation: Ametrano & Bianchetti (2013) — Multicurve Bootstrap.**

- New `tests/validation/test_paper_01_multicurve.py` — 10 tests reproducing EUR multicurve case study (11-Dec-2012):
  - OIS bootstrap from Eonia strip (12 pillars, round-trip < 1bp)
  - Negative rate handling (1Y OIS = 0%, DF ≈ 1.0)

## v0.641.0 — 2026-05-29

**Hard migration — remove aliases, tighten pv_ctx curve lookups.**

- Renamed `CDSIndexProduct.from_spec` → `from_convention` (removed alias). All callers + tests updated.
- Tightened `pv_ctx` curve extraction in 6 instruments:
  - `FRA`: tries keyed lookup by day_count before falling back to first projection curve.
  - `FRN`: same keyed lookup pattern.
  - `BasisSwap`: warns if fewer than 2 projection curves available.
  - `CapFloor`: **raises ValueError** if no IR vol surface in context (was silently using flat 20%).
  - `ConvertibleBond`: **raises ValueError** if missing spot, discount curve, or vol surface (was guessing defaults).
  - `RiskyBond`: warns if no credit curve found (falls back to risk-free with warning instead of silently).
- Old numerical shims: verified already removed in v0.612-v0.616. No action needed.
- **Breaking changes:** CapFloor.pv_ctx and ConvertibleBond.pv_ctx now raise instead of silently using bad defaults. Code that relied on the fallback behaviour must now provide proper market data in PricingContext.
- 9910 tests pass.

---

## v0.640.0 — 2026-05-29

**Supranational analytics — RV, universe pricing, curve spread (D9).**

- `supranational_rv()` — relative value: z-score vs historical spread, peer ranking, RICH/CHEAP/FAIR signal.

  - `greenium()` — green premium calculation (yield difference green vs conventional).
  - `esg_adjusted_spread()` — spread decomposition: credit + greenium + liquidity.
  - `slb_coupon_adjustment()` — sustainability-linked bond coupon step-up/down on KPI miss/achieve.
  - `create_green_bond()` — factory returning (FixedRateBond, ESGBondSpec) tuple.
- Full `@serialisable_convention` on ESGBondSpec with round-trip.
- **Backward compat:** Additive — new module, no changes to existing code.
- 9910 tests pass.

---

## v0.638.0 — 2026-05-28

**Sukuk instrument + pricing (D7).**

- New `SukukBond` class: profit rate (coupon equivalent), 7 Sukuk types (Ijara, Mudaraba, Murabaha, Wakala, Musharaka, Salam, Istisna).
- Curve-based pricing via internal FixedRateBond delegation. Spread-based pricing via `price_from_spread()`.
- Full architecture: `from_convention()`, `pv_ctx()`, `to_dict()`/`from_dict()`, `@serialisable`.
- `create_sukuk(type, issue, maturity, rate)` factory function.
- **Backward compat:** Additive. Existing `price_sukuk_as_bond()` unchanged.
- 9910 tests pass.

---

## v0.637.0 — 2026-05-28

**Composite convention pattern for exotic trees — TRS-on-SPV with nested conventions.**

- New `models/composite_convention.py` with 5 convention types: CouponCapSpec, FundingConvention, CollateralConvention, SPVNoteConvention, BondTRSConvention.
- `create_trs_on_spv()` convenience function. `BondTRSConvention.create()` builds underlying from nested conventions.
- Fixed `_deserialise_atom` for Python 3.10+ `types.UnionType` (`X | None`) and flat convention dict deserialisation.
- Full round-trip: nested convention → JSON → from_dict → create → instrument.
- **Backward compat:** Two fixes to core/serialisable.py improve nested deserialisation. No existing behaviour changed.
- 9910 tests pass.

---

## v0.636.0 — 2026-05-28

**Supranational bond factory + pricing.**

- `create_supranational_bond(issuer, currency, issue, maturity, coupon)` — creates FixedRateBond with domestic sovereign conventions for the issuance currency. Maps 10 currencies to sovereign market codes.
- `price_supranational()` — full pricing with spread vs sovereign computation.
- `SupranationalBondResult` — clean/dirty price, YTM, spread, rating.
- Warns if issuing in a non-typical currency for the supranational.
- **Backward compat:** Additive — existing `get_supranational()` / `list_supranationals()` unchanged.
- 9910 tests pass.

---

## v0.635.0 — 2026-05-28

**Complete @serialisable — all 5 remaining complex classes done.**

- `PedersenCDSSwaption`, `StochasticIntensitySwaption` — scalar params, standard decorator.
- `TotalReturnSwapLou` — scalar params, standard decorator.
- `CDSIndex` — custom to_dict/from_dict: serialises list of CDS constituents recursively.
- `CovenantLoan` — custom to_dict/from_dict: serialises nested TermLoan.
- **Backward compat:** All additive. CDSIndex and CovenantLoan use custom from_dict that dispatches via the Serialisable registry for nested objects.
- Total @serialisable instruments: **49** (was 44). Zero remaining gaps.
- 9910 tests pass.

---

## v0.634.0 — 2026-05-28

**JSON is now source of truth for all 11 convention registries.**

- All convention registries now load from JSON first, falling back to hardcoded Python defaults.
- New `load_registry()` utility in `core/data_registry.py` — populates keyed dicts from JSON arrays.
- Wired into: sovereign_conventions, rate_indices, equity_indices, commodity_contracts, linker_conventions, inflation_indices, repo_specialness, supranational_issuers, cds_indices, sovereign_cds, curve_conventions_em.
- Fixed CDS index names: `"iTraxx Europe"` → `"ITRAXX.EUR.IG"` etc. — name field now matches the lookup key (was a key/name mismatch from the original hardcoded dict).
- **Backward compat:** All `get_X()` APIs unchanged. JSON overrides hardcoded defaults when present. Editing a JSON file immediately changes what `get_conventions()` returns. CDS index spec name field changed from display name to canonical key — callers using `get_index_spec("ITRAXX.EUR.IG")` unaffected.
- G10 curve conventions (curve_builder.py) not wired — CurrencyConventions lacks a currency field for keying.
- 9910 tests pass.

---

## v0.633.0 — 2026-05-28

**from_convention on 12 more products — total 35 with factory.**

- Group 5 (Commodity): CommoditySwap (uses CommodityContractSpec).
- Group 8 (Repo): Repo, ReverseRepo (uses haircut from convention).
- **Backward compat:** CDSIndexProduct.from_convention = CDSIndexProduct.from_spec (alias). All others additive.
- Remaining without from_convention: options (strike/vol-driven, 10), desk trades (8), model-driven structured (4), TRS (3) — conventions don't apply the same way to these products.
- from_convention coverage: 23→35/39 core products. The 4 excluded categories (options/desk/structured-model/TRS) represent products where the concept of "market convention" is either the strike+vol (options) or the underlying itself (TRS).
- 9910 tests pass.

---

## v0.632.0 — 2026-05-27

**Convention + factory integration tests — 30 new tests, 9910 total.**

- New `test_convention_factory.py` with 30 tests covering the full chain:
  - Convention JSON round-trip (6 types)
  - Convention → factory → instrument (10 products: UST, Bund, ZCB, IRS USD/EUR, OIS, CDS, Swaption, Deposit, FRA)
  - Instrument → pv_ctx (5 products)
  - Instrument → to_dict → from_dict (5 products)
  - End-to-end: JSON load → convention → factory → price → serialise (4 chains)
- 9910 tests pass (was 9880).

---

## v0.631.0 — 2026-05-27

**from_convention on 3 more credit products — total 23 with factory.**

- `GuaranteedNote.from_convention()` — uses frequency/day_count from bond conventions.
- `VanillaCLN.from_convention()` — same pattern.
- `CreditRiskyFRN.from_convention()` — uses convention frequency/day_count for floating schedule.
- **Backward compat:** All additive.
- from_convention coverage: 20→23/39 products.
- 9880 tests pass.

---

## v0.630.0 — 2026-05-27

**from_convention on 7 more products — total 20 with factory.**

- `ZeroCouponSwap.from_convention()` — uses fixed_day_count from CurrencyConventions.
- `CrossCurrencySwap.from_convention()` — uses float freq/dc.
- `TermLoan.from_convention()` — uses float freq/dc for floating coupon.
- `Swaption.from_convention()` — uses fixed/float freq+dc from CurrencyConventions for underlying swap.
- `CapFloor.from_convention()` — uses float freq/dc for caplet/floorlet schedule.
- `TreasuryBill.from_convention()` — uses day_count + settlement from SovereignConventions.
- `Deposit.from_convention()` + `FRA.from_convention()` — already added in v0.628.0.
- **Backward compat:** All additive classmethods. IRFuture skipped (exchange-specific, not convention-driven).
- from_convention coverage: 13→20/39 products. Remaining ~19 are exotics (TRS, autocallable, etc.) or desk aggregates where conventions don't apply the same way.
- 9880 tests pass.

---

## v0.629.0 — 2026-05-27

**Complete @serialisable coverage — all 7 remaining gaps fixed.**

- `@serialisable` added to: LeveragedCLN, DIPLoan, TriPartyRepo, IndexLinkedHybridInstrument, DispersionTrade, DividendSwap, RiskReversal, VarianceSwap (8 classes).
- Total serialisable instrument classes: **44** (was 36).
- **Backward compat:** DIPLoan and TriPartyRepo `to_dict()` output changed from flat dict to standard `{"type": ..., "params": {...}}` format. Tests updated. TriPartyRepo serial type is `"triparty_repo"` (was `"tri_party_repo"` in one test).
- Only CDSIndex, CovenantLoan, PedersenCDSSwaption, StochasticIntensitySwaption, TotalReturnSwapLou remain without @serialisable (complex/nested params that need manual from_dict).
- 9880 tests pass.

---

## v0.628.0 — 2026-05-27

**Serialisable + pv_ctx + from_convention final batch.**

- `@serialisable` added to: CommoditySwap, RiskParticipation, BondFuture, FXFuture, CMSLeg (5 more instruments).
- `ConvertibleBond.pv_ctx()` — extracts spot, rate, vol, credit spread from PricingContext. All core tradeable products now have pv_ctx.
- `Deposit.from_convention()` and `FRA.from_convention()` — uses day_count from CurrencyConventions.
- **Backward compat:** All additive. 7 reverted files (desk trades with wrong field names, 4 credit/structured with import inside function body) will be fixed in a follow-up pass — no regression from v0.627.
- `@serialisable` coverage: 31→36 instruments. `from_convention` coverage: 11→13 products.
- 9880 tests pass.

---

## v0.627.0 — 2026-05-27

**from_convention on 5 more instruments — total 11 product types with factory.**

- `RiskyBond.from_convention(conv, start, end, coupon_rate, recovery)` — uses bond convention frequency/day_count.
- `CreditLinkedNote.from_convention(conv, start, end, coupon_rate, recovery)` — same pattern.

- **Backward compat:** All additive classmethods. No existing API changes.
- Factory coverage: 8→11/39 products with `from_convention`.
- 9880 tests pass.

---

## v0.626.0 — 2026-05-27

**from_convention factories on 6 core instrument classes.**

- `FixedRateBond.from_convention(conv, issue_date, maturity, coupon_rate)` — accepts SovereignConventions or any object with frequency/day_count/calendar_currency.
- `ZeroCouponBond.from_convention(conv, issue_date, maturity)` — same convention protocol.
- `FloatingRateNote.from_convention(conv, start, end, spread)` — uses convention frequency/day_count.
- `InterestRateSwap.from_convention(conv, start, end, fixed_rate)` — accepts CurrencyConventions (fixed/float freq+dc).
- `CDS.from_convention(conv, start, end, spread)` — accepts SovereignCDSConventions or CDSIndexSpec (extracts recovery).
- `OISSwap.from_convention(conv, start, end, fixed_rate)` — already added in v0.622.0.
- New `create_swap(currency, start, end, rate)` convenience function.
- New `get_conventions(currency)` in `curves/curve_builder.py`.
- Rewired `create_sovereign_bond`, `create_sovereign_zero`, `create_sovereign_frn` to use `from_convention` internally.
- **Backward compat:** All new classmethods and functions are additive. Existing factory functions (`create_sovereign_bond` etc.) now delegate to `from_convention` — same output, thinner implementation. FX instruments skipped (pair IS the convention — no separate convention layer needed).
- Factory coverage: 3/39 → ~8/39 products with `from_convention`.
- 9880 tests pass.

---

## v0.625.0 — 2026-05-27

**Serialisation hardening — @serialisable on 15 more instrument classes.**

- Added `@serialisable` to: ZCInflationSwap, YoYInflationSwap, InflationLinkedBond, CrossCurrencySwap, StepUpBond, RiskyBond, Repo (already had via alias), IRFuture, AmortisingBond, VanillaCLN, BasketCLN, GuaranteedNote, CMASWInstrument, CMTInstrument.
- Total serialisable instruments: 16→31 (now 80% of core tradeables).
- **Backward compat:** StepUpBond `to_dict()` output changed from flat dict to `{"type": "step_up_bond", "params": {...}}` format (standard instrument format). Other classes that had no `to_dict()` now have one (additive). Test updated.
- 9880 tests pass.

---

## v0.624.0 — 2026-05-27

**pv_ctx on 10 more instruments — coverage 35→39/39 (near-complete).**

- Added `pv_ctx()` to: ZeroCouponSwap, TreasuryBill, IRFuture, CrossCurrencySwap, ZCInflationSwap, YoYInflationSwap, InflationLinkedBond, BondForward, ParAssetSwap, ProceedsAssetSwap.
- CrossCurrencySwap.pv_ctx extracts domestic + foreign discount curves + FX spot from context.
- Inflation instruments extract CPI curve from `ctx.inflation_curves`.
- **Backward compat:** All additive — existing pricing signatures unchanged. `pv_ctx` methods use best-effort curve extraction.
- PricingContext coverage on core tradeable instruments: near-complete. Remaining gaps are desk-level aggregators (Book, Desk), result dataclasses, and niche credit exotics.
- 9880 tests pass.

---

## v0.623.0 — 2026-05-27

**pv_ctx on CapFloor and RiskyBond.**

- `CapFloor.pv_ctx()` — extracts discount + projection curves + IR vol from context, falls back to flat 20% vol.
- `RiskyBond.pv_ctx()` — extracts discount + credit curves, falls back to risk-free pricing if no credit curve.
- **Backward compat:** Additive — existing `price()` / `dirty_price()` signatures unchanged. `pv_ctx` uses best-effort curve extraction from context.
- PricingContext coverage: 33/39 → 35/39 products.
- 9880 tests pass.

---

## v0.622.0 — 2026-05-27

**OIS convention + pv_ctx on 8 vanilla instruments.**

- New `OISConvention` dataclass with `create_swap()` factory (10 currencies: USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, CHF, CAD, AUD, NZD, SEK, NOK). `get_ois_convention(currency)` lookup.
- `OISSwap.from_convention()` classmethod + `pv_ctx()`.
- Added `pv_ctx()` to 7 more instruments: Deposit, FRA, ZeroCouponBond, BasisSwap, FloatingRateNote, FXSwap, NDF, EquityForward.
- **Backward compat:** All new methods are additive. Existing `pv()` signatures unchanged. `OISConvention` + `get_ois_convention` are new exports. `pv_ctx` on BasisSwap picks first two projection curves from context — callers with specific curve needs should still use `pv()` directly.
- PricingContext coverage: 25/39 → 33/39 products.
- 9880 tests pass.

---

## v0.621.0 — 2026-05-26

**Static data layer — 13 JSON convention files + loader utility.**

- Created `data/` directory with 13 JSON files (62 KB total, 212 entries):
  sovereign_conventions (56), rate_indices (25), equity_indices (9), commodity_contracts (13), linker_conventions (8), inflation_indices (16), repo_specialness (6), supranational_issuers (10), cds_indices (5), sovereign_cds (31), curve_conventions_g10 (10), curve_conventions_em (16), sukuk_conventions (7).
- New `core/data_registry.py` — `load_conventions()`, `save_conventions()`, `load_or_default()` utilities for JSON ↔ convention dataclass round-trip.
- All 12 convention types verified: JSON → from_dict → to_dict → JSON matches original.
- **Backward compat:** JSON files are additive — existing hardcoded registries remain the source of truth. JSON files serve as export/inspection/override format. No existing APIs changed.
- 9880 tests pass.

---

## v0.620.0 — 2026-05-26

**Apply `@serialisable_convention` to all 13 convention dataclasses.**

- All convention types now have `to_dict()`/`from_dict()` round-trip via the decorator:
  RateIndex, EquityIndexSpec, CommodityContractSpec, LinkerConvention, InflationIndexDef, SpecialnessConventions, SupranationalIssuer, CDSIndexSpec, CDSSettlementConvention, SovereignCDSConventions, CurrencyConventions, EMCurveConventions, SukukConventions.
- 6 dataclasses made `frozen=True` (were mutable): EquityIndexSpec, CommodityContractSpec, LinkerConvention, CDSIndexSpec, CDSSettlementConvention, CurrencyConventions.
- Manual `to_dict()` methods removed (decorator auto-generates with proper enum serialisation).
- **Backward compat:** `to_dict()` output now includes all fields (some manual implementations omitted fields like `notes`, `settlement_days`). Existing `get_X()` / `list_X()` APIs unchanged. `from_dict()` is new (additive). Making dataclasses frozen could break code that mutates convention objects — none found in tests.
- 9880 tests pass.

---

## v0.619.0 — 2026-05-26

**Add `@serialisable_convention` decorator for frozen dataclasses.**

- New `serialisable_convention(serial_type)` decorator in `core/serialisable.py` — auto-derives `_SERIAL_FIELDS` from `dataclasses.fields()`, produces flat dicts (no type/params nesting), handles enum/date round-trip.
- Applied to `SovereignConventions` — first convention with full `to_dict()`/`from_dict()` round-trip.
- **Backward compat:** `SovereignConventions.to_dict()` now exists where it didn't before (additive, no breakage). The existing `get_conventions()` / `create_sovereign_bond()` APIs unchanged.
- 9880 tests pass.

---

## v0.618.0 — 2026-05-26

**Restore clean dependency layers — 0 cycles, 9 layers.**

- Made 2 module-level imports lazy (moved inside function bodies):
  - `models/regime_pricing.py` — `equity_option_price`, `equity_delta`, `equity_gamma`, `equity_vega` from options
  - `curves/rfr_bootstrap.py` — `RFRFutureSpec`, `rfr_futures_to_forwards` from fixed_income
- AST-verified: 0 bidirectional cycles at module level across all 20 packages.

**Delete tree model shims — all callers migrated to solve_tree().**

- Deleted `models/binomial_tree.py`, `models/trinomial_tree.py`, `models/binomial_jr_lr.py` — thin shims, zero remaining importers.

- Registry already clean (uses `solve_tree` since v0.612.0).
- 9844 tests pass.

---

---

## v0.613.0 — 2026-05-24

**Fix Leisen-Reimer Peizer-Pratt formula — extra 0.5 factor removed.**
