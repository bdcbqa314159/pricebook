## A.1 — `core/day_count.py`

**Purpose:** Year-fraction calculations across 7 day-count conventions (ACT/360, ACT/365F, 30/360 US, 30E/360, ACT/ACT ISDA, ACT/ACT ICMA, BUS/252). Plus `business_days_between` and `date_from_year_fraction` helpers.

**Internal deps:** Only `pricebook.core.calendar` (TYPE_CHECKING import + one lazy runtime import of `SaoPauloCalendar`). True L0.

**Caller fan-in:** 72 references to `ACT_ACT_ICMA` alone across the library — fixed-income (sovereigns, EM, linkers), inflation, govt-bond pricing. Anything that touches a bond touches this module.

**Test file:** `python/tests/test_day_count.py` (144 lines, 4 test classes).

### Status: ⚠️ Real bugs found

### Confirmed bugs

#### B1 — `_act_act_icma` silent fallback to ACT/365F masks bond mispricing  *[HIGH]*

**Location:** `day_count.py:167-168, 172`.

```python
if ref_start is None or ref_end is None or frequency is None:
    return (end - start).days / 365.0  # silent fallback to ACT/365F
period_days = (ref_end - ref_start).days
if period_days <= 0:
    return (end - start).days / 365.0  # second silent fallback
```

When a caller selects `DayCountConvention.ACT_ACT_ICMA` but forgets to supply the coupon-period anchors, the function quietly degrades to ACT/365F and returns a *similar-but-wrong* year fraction. The error is small in magnitude (~0.1–0.4% per period) but compounds across coupons.

**Downstream impact (confirmed via MODULE_HEALTH §`fixed_income/bond.py` audit):** `FixedRateBond.treasury_note` calls `year_fraction(..., ACT_ACT_ICMA, ...)` *without* passing `ref_start`, `ref_end`, `frequency`. So every US Treasury note priced via this path is silently using ACT/365F:

- Semi-annual UST coupons come out as 1.9836 or 2.0164 per 100 instead of the canonical exact 2.0000.
- Accrued interest is wrong by ~0.8% mid-period.
- Par-yield round-trip lands at 99.9998 (5y) or 99.9995 (30y) instead of exactly 100.

UST is quoted in 32nds (~3.1 bp). The error is **observable in market quotes**.

**Fix shape:** raise `ValueError` instead of falling back. Multi-slice because all 72 ICMA call-sites that don't pass refs need to be located + fixed (likely many).

**Slicing proposal:**
- *Slice 1*: add a `strict_icma` flag (default `False` — keep current behaviour). Tests: ref-dates-present passes; ref-dates-absent raises under `strict_icma=True`.
- *Slice 2..N*: one slice per affected caller — switch caller to pass ref dates; verify with a hand-calc test (e.g. "par UST gives 2.0000 per coupon").
- *Final slice*: flip default to `True`, remove flag.

This pattern surfaces every miscalibrated bond in the library one at a time, with a failing test per call-site.

#### B2 — `_act_act_icma(frequency=0)` raises `ZeroDivisionError`  *[LOW]*

**Location:** `day_count.py:174`.

```python
return (end - start).days / (period_days * frequency)
```

When `frequency=0` is passed (caller error or deserialised-bad-config), the second guard (`period_days <= 0`) doesn't catch it because `period_days > 0`. We hit `divide-by-zero`.

**Repro (confirmed live):**
```
_act_act_icma(date(2024,1,1), date(2024,7,1),
              date(2024,1,1), date(2024,7,1), 0)
→ ZeroDivisionError
```

**Fix:** validate `frequency > 0` (and `period_days > 0`) and raise `ValueError` with a clear message. Single slice.

### Documentation / naming issues

- **D1 — `_thirty_360` is misnamed "ISDA 2006".** The docstring labels the rule set "ISDA 2006" but actually implements 30/360 US (SIA Bond Basis). Pure ISDA 2006 §4.16(f) "Bond Basis" does *not* include the end-of-Feb adjustment. Code is correct for US bonds; the *citation* is wrong. Trivial doc fix.
- **D2 — `date_from_year_fraction` uses 365.25 regardless of convention.** That's "calendar years" (Julian), not "ACT/365 years" or any other. Doesn't round-trip with any specific day-count. The contract is fine for charts and approximate alignment, but the docstring should explicitly say "calendar year (365.25 days)" so callers don't expect convention-aware behaviour.
- **D3 — `business_days_between` uses `(start, end]`** — settlement counts, trade does not. Reasonable but disagrees with the literal Anbima/B3 `[t, T)` for BRL DU. Should be documented explicitly.

### Test gaps

The existing test file covers ACT/360, ACT/365F, 30/360 (regular + d=31), and BUS/252 well. Missing:

- **30E/360** — zero tests. Convention used for Eurobonds, Bunds, EUR corporates.
- **ACT/ACT ISDA cross-year** — zero tests. Year-boundary split is non-trivial.
- **ACT/ACT ICMA** — zero tests. The most important convention for govt bond markets. A test like "par UST 5y semi-annual → exact 0.5 per coupon" would catch B1 immediately.
- **30/360 end-of-Feb edge cases** — zero tests. e.g. Jan 31 → Feb 28 (non-leap) or Feb 29 (leap).
- **`date_from_year_fraction`** — zero tests. Function has no coverage at all.

## A.2 — `core/calendar.py`

**Purpose:** Business-day calendars for 39 currencies + `JointCalendar` for multi-cal intersections + `BusinessDayConvention` enum (FOLLOWING / MODIFIED_FOLLOWING / PRECEDING / MODIFIED_PRECEDING / UNADJUSTED) + `get_calendar(ccy)` factory.

**Internal deps:** None. Pure datetime arithmetic + the Anonymous Gregorian Easter algorithm + Meeus Julian (orthodox Easter). Truly L0.

**Size:** 1316 lines, 38 calendar classes, ~30 holiday-rule helpers.

**Test file:** `python/tests/test_calendar.py` (133 lines, 1 calendar tested out of 39).

### Status: ⚠️ Real bugs found

### Confirmed bugs

#### B1 — Wrong weekend-substitute rule for UK / AU / NZ / CA  *[HIGH]*

**Location:** `calendar.py:93-100` (base `_observe`) + `LondonCalendar`, `AUDCalendar`, `NZDCalendar`, `CADCalendar`.

The base `Calendar._observe(d)` implements the **US** rule:
- Saturday → previous Friday
- Sunday → next Monday

That is correct for US federal holidays (5 U.S.C. § 6103) but **wrong** for:
- **UK** — Banking and Financial Dealings Act 1971: Sat/Sun → next available working day (i.e. Saturday → Monday, NOT Friday).
- **AU** — Public Holidays Act: same rule, Sat → Mon.
- **NZ** — Holidays Act 2003: same rule.
- **CA** — federal/provincial bank holidays: same rule.

**Live repro:** Christmas 2021 (Dec 25 Saturday) and Christmas 2027 (Dec 25 Saturday). The wrong dates are produced by all four calendars:

```
London 2021-12-24 Fri: is_holiday=True  ❌  (should be business day)
London 2021-12-27 Mon: is_holiday=True  ✓   (Christmas-observed-Mon by happy accident
                                              from Boxing-Day-Sunday → Monday)
London 2021-12-28 Tue: is_holiday=False ❌  (should be Boxing-Day-observed-Tue)
```

Same pattern on AUD, NZD, CAD. Recurs whenever Dec 25 falls on Saturday — 2021, 2027, 2032, etc. — and for other holidays whose date falls on Saturday in the locale (Australia Day Sat 26 Jan → wrong Fri Jan 25 in AUD).

**Fix shape:**
1. Add a class-level `_observe_rule` constant or override per locale (US-style vs UK-style vs "no substitution" for TARGET/Tokyo).
2. Bump tests dramatically — for each substitute-rule calendar, test a Sat-Christmas year (2021 or 2027) explicitly.

Multi-slice — one slice per affected calendar to keep blast radius small.

#### B2 — Tokyo has no substitute-day rule at all  *[MEDIUM]*

**Location:** `calendar.py:225-246` (`TokyoCalendar._compute_holidays`).

Japanese Public Holiday Act § 3.2: "if a national holiday falls on Sunday, the next non-holiday day is a holiday in place of it" (振替休日, *furikae kyūjitsu*). None of TokyoCalendar's holidays use `_observe` — Sunday holidays are simply lost.

**Impact:** Lower than B1 because (a) the multi-day 1-3 Jan New Year block absorbs most year-start cases and (b) JPY FX/IR has fewer Saturday-on-holiday cases than USD/GBP. But every year where (say) Showa Day Apr 29 falls on Sunday, JPY funding curves silently disagree with market conventions.

**Fix:** Apply `furikae kyūjitsu` rule to single-day Tokyo holidays.

#### B3 — `_nth_weekday` silently spills into adjacent month  *[LOW]*

**Location:** `calendar.py:103-108`.

```python
@staticmethod
def _nth_weekday(year: int, month: int, weekday: int, n: int) -> date:
    first = date(year, month, 1)
    days_to_add = (weekday - first.weekday()) % 7
    first_occurrence = first + timedelta(days=days_to_add)
    return first_occurrence + timedelta(weeks=n - 1)
```

No validation of `n`. Live repro:

```
5th Mon of Feb 2024 → 2024-03-04 Mon   (Feb 2024 has only 4 Mondays)
0th Mon of Feb 2024 → 2024-01-29 Mon   (n=0 rolls back)
-1th Mon of Feb 2024 → 2024-01-22 Mon  (negative rolls back further)
```

The "5th" case is a real concern if any new calendar tries to encode something like "5th Friday of the month" (DST transitions in some jurisdictions). The `n <= 0` cases are pure defensive — no caller exercises them today.

**Fix:** Validate `1 <= n <= 5`; raise `ValueError`; return the result only if it stays in `month`.

#### B4 — `is_holiday` Y-1 spill window is defensive but fragile  *[LOW]*

**Location:** `calendar.py:31-34`.

The current window is `(d.year, d.year + 1)`. Catches the typical case (Jan 1 Sat → Dec 31 prev year observed) because that observed date is generated by *next* year's `_compute_holidays`. But it does **not** catch the symmetric case where year Y's compute generates a date in year Y+1. No current calendar emits such a Y→Y+1 spill, so this is dormant.

**Fix:** Widen window to `(d.year - 1, d.year, d.year + 1)` for safety. Tiny cost (one extra year cached), zero behaviour change today.

#### B5 — `JointCalendar` mutates components' `_holiday_cache`  *[LOW]*

**Location:** `calendar.py:1233-1239`.

```python
def _compute_holidays(self, year: int) -> set[date]:
    holidays = set()
    for cal in self._calendars:
        if year not in cal._holiday_cache:
            cal._holiday_cache[year] = cal._compute_holidays(year)
        holidays |= cal._holiday_cache[year]
    return holidays
```

Pollutes each component's private cache. If the same component calendar is shared across threads OR is used standalone elsewhere, there's a (cooperative-multitasking) race on `_holiday_cache`. Not a Python-thread-safety bug (GIL covers the dict ops), but the implicit aliasing makes ownership murky.

**Fix:** Use a local computation only; don't reach into `cal._holiday_cache`. Cost: re-computing the component's holidays when used inside a Joint — but joint cals are rare and small.

### Test gaps — major

`test_calendar.py` exercises **only** `USSettlementCalendar` (NYSE/SIFMA holidays + adjust conventions). The other 38 calendars — TARGET, London, Tokyo, all EM cals — have **zero direct test coverage**.

Highest-impact additions:
- TARGET (Easter shifting, no-substitute rule, 26 Dec)
- London + AUD + NZD + CAD on Sat-Christmas years (2021, 2027) — would catch B1 immediately.
- SaoPaulo Carnival + Independence Day (already lightly covered in `test_day_count.py`).
- Mumbai Diwali, Beijing Spring Festival — these are openly *not* implemented (lunar calendars are accepted approximations); document the gap in a test that asserts what IS covered.

### Accepted approximations (already documented in code)

- Tokyo vernal equinox = Mar 21 fixed; autumnal = Sep 23 fixed (actual dates vary ±1 day).
- Tel Aviv Hebrew calendar approximated by fixed Gregorian dates.
- Islamic-calendar holidays in MENA calendars (RiyadhCalendar, etc.) — omitted.
- Chinese lunar New Year, Mid-Autumn — omitted in BeijingCalendar, HongKongCalendar, etc.

These are openly disclaimed and acceptable for the library's current scope (G10 + EM curves, not regional equity).

## A.3 — `core/currency.py`

**Purpose:** G10 currency enum + `CurrencyPair` with ACI market-convention base/quote priority + settlement lag + CIP forward formulas + `all_g10_pairs()`.

**Internal deps:** None (`DiscountCurve` is TYPE_CHECKING only). True L0.

**Size:** 138 lines.

**Test file:** `python/tests/test_currency.py` (80 lines, 4 test classes).

### Status: 📝 No bugs found; test gaps

### Correctness review

- `Currency` enum: 10 G10 ISO codes (EUR, GBP, AUD, NZD, USD, CAD, CHF, NOK, SEK, JPY). ✓
- `_BASE_PRIORITY`: matches ACI standard (EUR > GBP > AUD > NZD > USD > CAD > CHF > NOK > SEK > JPY). ✓
- `from_currencies` correctly picks the higher-priority base. ✓
- `settlement_lag` correctly handles inverse-key lookup so `CAD/USD` and `USD/CAD` both return T+1. ✓
- `forward_rate(spot, r_base, r_quote, T) = spot × exp((r_quote − r_base) × T)`: correct continuous-rate CIP for a quote-per-base convention. ✓
- `forward_rate_from_curves`: `S × df_base / df_quote`. ✓
- `CurrencyPair` hash/equality look standard. ✓

### Minor concerns (not bugs)

- **`is_ndf` is dead code** given the strict `Currency` enum. The property asks "is base or quote *not* in G10?" but the type system prevents non-G10 construction. Two ways to fix: (a) add an `EMCurrency` enum & accept it in `CurrencyPair` so the check has teeth, or (b) remove `is_ndf` until EM-FX lands. Pick when EM-FX work starts.
- Docstring of `forward_rate` doesn't state that `r_base`/`r_quote` are *continuously* compounded — caller could plausibly plug in simple rates and get a small but systematic error.

### Test gaps

- **`settlement_lag`**: not tested. Especially the USD/CAD T+1 exception.
- **`forward_rate` / `forward_rate_from_curves` / `forward_points`**: untested. These are the core FX formulas.
- **`is_ndf`**: untested (will always be `False` given the current enum, but the test would document the contract).
- **`all_g10_pairs`**: untested. Should assert count = 45 and all pairs in market convention.

Single test-coverage slice to land all four. No source changes needed.

## A.4 — `core/schedule.py`

**Purpose:** Generate cashflow schedules between `start` and `end` at a given `Frequency`, with stub type (SHORT/LONG × FRONT/BACK), EOM rule, and optional calendar adjustment.

**Internal deps:** `pricebook.core.calendar` (for adjustment). External: `dateutil.relativedelta`.

**Size:** 127 lines.

**Test file:** `python/tests/test_schedule.py` (164 lines).

### Status: ⚠️ One real bug found

### Confirmed bugs

#### B1 — EOM anchored to `end` (not `start`) in front-stub backward generation  *[HIGH for amortising / off-EOM-end trades]*

**Location:** `schedule.py:85-92` + `_add_months:25-30`.

The backward generator initialises `current = end` and steps backward via `_add_months(current, -months, eom)`. Inside `_add_months`, the EOM check is:
```python
if eom and d == _end_of_month(d):
    result = _end_of_month(result)
```
which is anchored to `d` — i.e. the *current rolling date*. For the front-stub path that's effectively `end`. So when `start` is EOM but `end` is **not** EOM, the EOM rule never fires and interior rolls land mid-month.

**ISDA 2006 §4.10 (End of Month Convention):** *"if the [period start date] is the last day of February, the [period end date] is the last day of February. If the [period end date] is the last day of February, the [next period end date] is the last day of February."* — i.e. EOM anchors to *start*, propagates forward.

**Live repro:**
```
start=2024-01-31 (EOM), end=2024-08-15 (not EOM), semi-annual, SF, eom=True:
  current behaviour: [2024-01-31, 2024-02-15, 2024-08-15]
                                  ^^^^^^^^^^ should be 2024-02-29 (EOM)

start=2024-01-31 (EOM), end=2025-04-15 (not EOM), semi-annual, SF, eom=True:
  current behaviour: [2024-01-31, 2024-04-15, 2024-10-15, 2025-04-15]
                                  ^^^^^^^^^^ should be 2024-04-30 (EOM)
                                              ^^^^^^^^^^ should be 2024-10-31 (EOM)
```

Affected trades: any with EOM start and non-EOM end. Common cases:
- Amortising swaps where end is a calendar quarter-end day-15 instead of EOM.
- Bond schedules where start is the issue date (often EOM) and end is the maturity (often *not* EOM, set by deal economics).
- Cross-currency basis swaps where EOM convention is asymmetric between legs.

**Fix shape:** Pass an explicit `eom_anchor` date into `_add_months` (i.e. always `start`), independent of the rolling `current`. Or, recompute backward rolls forward after the loop. Either way, a focused 1-slice fix with a regression test covering the exact ISDA §4.10 cases above. The forward path is already correct (it anchors on `start` by accident because `current` is initialised to `start`).

### Robustness concerns (not bugs, but worth noting)

- **`months * 30` stub heuristic** at lines 98 and 116: classifies a stub as "tiny" if its day-count < 50% of `months * 30`. For quarterly (months=3) the threshold is 45 days, so a 44-day quarterly stub is silently merged on LONG_FRONT. The 30-day approximation also doesn't account for actual month lengths; could swing  ±10% per case.
- **Post-adjustment dedup**: after `calendar.adjust(d, convention)` two consecutive raw rolls could both shift to the same business day (dense stubs, holiday clusters) or even invert (if `MODIFIED_FOLLOWING` pushes one forward and the next backward). The code returns the adjusted list as-is. Audit critic flagged this.
- **`WEEKLY` ignores `eom`** — silently. Probably fine (EOM ⊥ weekly) but documenting would help.
- **`stub` default is `SHORT_FRONT`** — sensible default for fixed-income; sometimes surprising for FX/EQ. Mention in docstring.

### Test gaps

- **EOM anchoring bug coverage** — currently `test_eom_preserved` only checks start=EOM **and** end=EOM, so the bug is invisible. A test with `start=2024-01-31`, `end=2025-04-15`, semi-annual would catch it immediately.
- **Post-adjustment ordering/dedup**: no test. Build a scenario where two raw rolls collide post-adjust.
- **WEEKLY**: no test (frequency=0 branch).
- **LONG_BACK**: not tested (only LONG_FRONT).
- **stub heuristic boundary**: no test for the "44-day quarterly stub merges, 46-day doesn't" case.

## A.5 — `core/solvers.py`

**Purpose:** 1D root finders — `newton` (Newton-Raphson), `secant`, `halley` (cubic convergence using f, f', f''), `itp` (Interpolate-Truncate-Project bracketing), `brentq` (Brent's method). All return `SolverResult` except `brentq` (returns `float` for backward compat).

**Internal deps:** None.

**Size:** 247 lines. Test file: 152 lines.

### Status: ⚠️ 2 minor bugs

### Confirmed bugs

#### B1 — `SolverResult.to_dict()` returns mutable shared `__dict__`  *[LOW]*

**Location:** `solvers.py:27-28`.

```python
def to_dict(self) -> dict:
    return vars(self)
```

`vars(self)` returns `self.__dict__` directly. Mutating the returned dict mutates the dataclass.

**Live repro:**
```
r = SolverResult(root=1.0, ...)
d = r.to_dict()
d['root'] = 999.0
# r.root is now 999.0
```

**Fix:** `return dict(vars(self))` (one-character fix).

#### B2 — `itp` silently overrides user `maxiter` cap and misreports iteration count  *[LOW]*

**Location:** `solvers.py:137, 174`.

```python
for i in range(max(maxiter, n_max)):     # line 137
    ...
return SolverResult(..., iterations=maxiter, ...)  # line 174
```

Two issues:
1. The loop uses `max(maxiter, n_max)` where `n_max = ceil(log2((b-a)/(2*tol))) + 1`. For tight `tol` and wide bracket, `n_max` can exceed `maxiter`. User's request for "no more than 5 iterations" is silently increased.
2. When the loop budget is exhausted, the result reports `iterations=maxiter` instead of the actual loop counter `i`. Reported count disagrees with the actual evaluations.

**Live repro:**
```
itp(f, 0.0, 1.5, tol=1e-14, maxiter=5)
# Actually runs 7 iterations (n_max=7 > maxiter=5)
# Reports iterations=5
```

**Fix:** Either (a) honour `maxiter` strictly and emit a "did-not-converge" warning, or (b) document that ITP's worst-case bound supersedes `maxiter` and at least set `iterations=i+1` in the timeout-return path.

### Robustness concerns (not bugs)

- **`newton`, `secant`, `halley`**: silently `break` on near-zero denominator (|f'| < 1e-15) without warning. The `converged` field captures it, but a caller iterating multiple seeds gets no signal which one failed and why. Add `RuntimeWarning`.
- **`brentq` warning threshold** at line 239 is hard-coded `tol * 1000`. Inconsistent: ITP/Newton don't have a similar "loose-OK" tolerance. Pick one policy.
- **`brentq` returns `float`** — breaks the `SolverResult` contract of every other solver in the module. Docstring acknowledges this is for back-compat. Worth tracking for a future migration.
- **NaN/Inf handling**: none of the solvers explicitly check for NaN/Inf. If `f(x)` returns NaN, the abs-comparison silently returns False, and the iteration continues until maxiter exhaustion. Result: `root=NaN, converged=False`. Mostly survives but provides no diagnostic.

### Test gaps

- No tests for `to_dict` (would catch B1).
- No tests for `itp` with tight tolerance / small maxiter (would catch B2).
- No tests for the maxiter-exhausted return path on any solver.
- No tests for NaN/Inf propagation.
- No tests for near-zero-derivative cases in `newton`/`halley`/`secant`.

## A.6 — `core/interpolation.py`

**Purpose:** 5 1-D interpolators: `Linear`, `LogLinear` (linear-in-log-y, the discount-curve standard), `CubicSpline` (scipy natural), `MonotoneCubic` (Fritsch-Carlson + Hyman filter), `Akima`. Each subclasses an `Interpolator` ABC and the module provides a `create_interpolator(method, x, y)` factory.

**Internal deps:** None (NumPy + scipy.interpolate). True L0.

**Size:** 271 lines.

### Status: 📝 No bugs found

### Correctness review

- **Base `Interpolator`**: validates length, ≥2 points, strictly-increasing x. Left extrapolation is hardcoded flat. Right extrapolation is overridable; only `LogLinearInterpolator` actually overrides (with the standard "extend last segment's slope in log space" → piecewise-constant forward in the last segment). ✓
- **`LinearInterpolator`**: standard t-blend on `[x_i, x_{i+1}]`. ✓
- **`LogLinearInterpolator`**: linear in `log(y)`, equivalent to piecewise-constant forward rates between knots. Slope-continued right extrapolation is correct. ✓
- **`CubicSplineInterpolator`**: defers to `scipy.interpolate.CubicSpline(..., bc_type="natural")`. ✓
- **`MonotoneCubicInterpolator`**:
  - Fritsch-Carlson interior slopes via harmonic mean (set to 0 when adjacent secants disagree in sign or one is flat). ✓
  - One-sided endpoint slopes. ✓
  - Hyman filter `α² + β² ≤ 9` (de Boor / Hyman scaling). ✓
  - **Subtle**: filter is applied per segment in a single forward pass, mutating `slopes[i+1]` in place; the next iteration reads the already-modified slope. This is the standard "naive Hyman" approach; can produce slightly different slopes from a two-pass "compute-then-clip-all" implementation in pathological cases. Not a bug — matches the textbook formula — but worth knowing if comparing against another library.
- **`AkimaInterpolator`**: Akima slopes with ghost-secant boundary treatment, fallback to mid-secant when both weights are zero. ✓
- **`_find_segment`**: `np.searchsorted` with clamping to `[0, n-2]`. ✓
- **`create_interpolator` factory**: covers all 5 methods. ✓

### Design observations (not bugs)

- **Right extrapolation default is flat for cubic methods** — `CubicSpline`, `MonotoneCubic`, `Akima` all inherit the base `_extrapolate_right` that returns `self._y[-1]`. This introduces a derivative kink at the right boundary, which can be surprising for callers who interpolated with a cubic method expecting smooth extrapolation. The behaviour is acceptable for curves (rates are typically extrapolated flat) but should be explicit in the docstrings.
- **Left extrapolation is not overridable** — there's no `_extrapolate_left` hook symmetric to `_extrapolate_right`. Niche but reduces customisability.
- **No `to_dict`** on interpolators — fine, curves serialise via the method enum and rebuild.

### Test gaps

- **`AkimaInterpolator` has zero tests** (entire `TestAkima` class is missing from `test_interpolation.py`). The `TestFactory::test_all_methods` exercises it weakly via knot-recovery only.
- **`LogLinearInterpolator` right-extrap slope continuation** — the override is non-trivial and untested. Easy to add.
- **Monotone Hyman clipping path** — no test specifically covers a case where `α² + β² > 9` triggers `tau` scaling. Build a configuration with a sharp slope change.
- **2-point edge cases** — Akima and MonotoneCubic have n=2 guards (line 224/226 for Akima; loop range for MonotoneCubic) but no direct tests.
- **`Interpolator._find_segment` boundary behaviour** at exact knot values is untested at the deepest internal level (though indirectly covered by `test_at_knots`).

## A.7 — `core/approximation.py`

**Purpose:** Approximation-theory primitives:
- `chebyshev_interpolate` / `_clenshaw` / `ChebyshevInterpolant` — Chebyshev-Lobatto polynomial interpolation + Clenshaw eval.
- `pade_approximant` / `PadeApproximant` — Padé [L/M] rational approximation from Taylor coefficients.
- `richardson_table` / `RichardsonTable` — full Romberg/Richardson extrapolation table.
- `bspline_basis` — Cox-de Boor recursion.

**Internal deps:** None. True L0.

**Size:** 274 lines.

### Status: 📝 No real bugs; same `to_dict` mutation pattern as A.5

### Correctness review

- **Chebyshev** path: standard Chebyshev-Lobatto nodes `x_k = cos(kπ/n)` and DCT-I formula for coefficients. Endpoint weights `1.0` (vs `2.0` for interior) ✓. Divide-by-2 on first/last coefficients ✓ — standard Chebyshev convention. The DCT is implemented as a double Python loop (O(n²)) — correct but slow; could use `scipy.fft.dct` for a 10-100× speedup at n=50+. Not a bug.
- **Clenshaw** recurrence is the textbook formulation. ✓
- **Padé** linear system — checked the indexing carefully against the matching equations `Σ_{j=1}^{M} c_{L+i-j} q_j = -c_{L+i+1}` for i=1..M, then for the numerator `p_k = Σ_{j=0}^{min(k,M)} c_{k-j} q_j`. Both correct (`A[i,j] = c[L+i-j]`; `b[i] = -c[L+i+1]`; `numer[k] = Σ denom[j] c[k-j]`). ✓
- **Richardson table**: `T[i,j] = (r·T[i,j-1] − T[i-1,j-1]) / (r−1)` with `r = 2^{p·j}`. Standard Romberg formula. ✓
- **Cox-de Boor**: standard recursion with the half-open-on-the-right convention. The right-boundary `x == knots[-1]` evaluating to 0 for the last basis support is the textbook quirk — accepted approximation.

### Confirmed (trivial) bugs

#### B1 — Three `to_dict` methods return mutable shared `__dict__`  *[LOW]*

**Location:** `approximation.py:48-49, 133-134, 202-203`.

Same shape as A.5 B1. `ChebyshevInterpolant.to_dict`, `PadeApproximant.to_dict`, `RichardsonTable.to_dict` all do `return vars(self)`. Caller mutation propagates to the dataclass instance.

**Fix:** One audit slice will fix all four occurrences (3 here + 1 in `solvers.py`). Trivial.

### Test coverage

`test_approximation.py` covers happy paths for all four primitives — polynomial exactness for Chebyshev, exp accuracy, Padé [2/2] for exp, Richardson exact extrapolation, B-spline partition of unity. Adequate; no major gaps.

### Style / non-blocking

- Chebyshev DCT in pure-Python loops — replaceable by `scipy.fft.dct(fx, type=1)` for clean code + significant speedup at high `n`. Defer.
- `bspline_basis` is recursive in pure Python — fine for moderate degrees; could memoise if used hotly (no caller does today).

## Aggregate slicing queue (will work after audit pass)

From A.1 (`day_count`):
1. Test gap fill: ACT/ACT ICMA + ACT/ACT ISDA + 30E/360 + 30/360-EOF + `date_from_year_fraction`.
2. B2 fix: validate `frequency > 0` in ICMA (single slice).
3. D1: rename `_thirty_360` docstring "ISDA 2006" → "30/360 US (Bond Basis)".
4. D2: clarify `date_from_year_fraction` calendar-year semantics.
5. B1 (multi-slice): introduce `strict_icma` flag; per-caller migration; flip default. Sized as its own mini-roadmap inside Gate 2.

From A.2 (`calendar`):
6. Calendar test scaffolding: parametrised holiday-truth tests for every cal class (one slice — pure tests, no source changes; will start failing for B1/B2 calendars, which is the point).
7. B3 fix: validate `1 <= n <= 5` in `_nth_weekday`; raise on out-of-range.
8. B5 fix: stop mutating components' `_holiday_cache` from `JointCalendar`.
9. B4 fix: widen `is_holiday` window to `(Y-1, Y, Y+1)`.
10. B1 fix (multi-slice, one per calendar): override `_observe` for London → AUD → NZD → CAD with UK 1971-style "next available working day" rule. One slice per calendar so failing-test surface is clean.
11. B2 fix: implement *furikae kyūjitsu* on `TokyoCalendar`.

From A.3 (`currency`):
12. Tests for `settlement_lag` (USD/CAD T+1; others T+2), `forward_rate`/`forward_rate_from_curves`/`forward_points`, `is_ndf`, `all_g10_pairs` (count = 45, all market convention). Single slice.

From A.4 (`schedule`):
13. B1 fix: anchor EOM on `start` regardless of generation direction. Add regression test with `start=2024-01-31, end=2025-04-15, semi-annual` to catch the front-stub case.
14. Test gap fill: WEEKLY, LONG_BACK, post-adjust dedup/ordering. Single slice.

From A.5 (`solvers`):
15. B1 fix: `SolverResult.to_dict` returns a copy (one-line fix + test).
16. B2 fix: honour `maxiter` in ITP and report actual iteration count.
17. Test gap fill: NaN/Inf, near-zero-derivative, maxiter-exhausted return paths. Single slice.

From A.6 (`interpolation`):
18. Test gap fill: `TestAkima` class (knot recovery, smoothness, ghost-boundary 2-point), `LogLinear` right-extrap slope continuation, Hyman α²+β²>9 clipping path. Single slice.

From A.7 (`approximation`):
19. Generic `to_dict` mutation fix — patches A.5 `SolverResult` + A.7 `ChebyshevInterpolant`/`PadeApproximant`/`RichardsonTable` in one slice (`return dict(vars(self))`). Add a regression test that mutates the dict.

(More entries will arrive as the audit walks through Pass A.)
