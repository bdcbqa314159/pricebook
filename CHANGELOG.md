All notable changes are recorded here, in
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) format. `pricebook.__version__` is the
single source of truth and CI asserts it matches the top entry.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.0] - 2026-10-30

### Added
- **The clean project scaffold.** An empty, CI-green library at `v0.0.0` — no pricing code.
  Package `pricebook`, MIT, public. `pyproject.toml`, one trivial test, the ubuntu+windows CI
  matrix on Python 3.12, and `verify.py` carried from the migration tree and **trimmed to the
  gates that still apply**.
- **The stock.** The whole previous tree — the built core, the un-migrated `quarry/`, its `docs/`
  and all 77 oracle test files — shelved in `_stock/` and **gitignored**: reference material,
  mined by hand for *content*, never for *structure*, never imported. Its pushed backup is the
  archived `pricebook-migration` repo at tag `migration-archive`.
- **`docs/handoffs/phase_R_record.md`** — what Phase R did, the three parameters Bernardo ruled
  before execution, and the four `verify.py` calls taken under delegated mechanics.
- **`docs/conventions_register.md`** carried as a tracked living doc, because it describes the
  built core rather than the migration — including its one **OWED** item, the vol clock, which
  the rebuild re-lays *with* its cross-module oracle.

### Changed
- **The migration frame is retired** (`docs/handoffs/rulings_reset_to_fresh_repo.md`). The unit of
  work is now a product you want, pulling in the core it needs; `done` is no longer "the quarry is
  empty". The architecture, the oracle discipline and the conventions are kept; the obligation to
  cross every old module is dropped.
- **`verify.py` trimmed:** the `quarry` import-floor gate and the drawdown reconciliation are
  **deleted** — both measured migration progress, and there is no migration to measure. Kept:
  `acyclic`, `layers`, `fields`, `debt`, `provenance`, `version`, `slow`, `tests`.
- **Provenance header: `quarry:` → `stock:`**, same role against the new reference tree. Because
  `_stock/` is gitignored and therefore absent in CI, the resolve-check **reports** that it could
  not dereference paths rather than skipping silently — a gate that quietly passes is this
  project's named defect class. `source:` and `oracle:` are verified in both environments.
- **License corrected to MIT** in `pyproject.toml`, matching the `LICENSE` file (the old tree's
  metadata said Proprietary).
