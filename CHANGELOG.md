# Changelog

All notable changes to the new tree (`pricebook_ng`) are recorded here, in
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) format. `0.x` = migration
in progress; `1.0.0` is reached exactly when the quarry (`python/pricebook/`) is empty.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.1] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- **Slice 0 — walking skeleton.** A single fixed cashflow discounted on a flat,
  continuously-compounded curve, priced end-to-end L0->L6 through the stateless
  engine. Proves the spine holds before any further migration.
  - L0 `Money`/`Currency`, `Cashflow` (promoted from `fixed_income`),
    `year_fraction` (ACT/365F), `NumericalConfig`, `PricingResult`/`PricingFailure`.
  - L1 `MarketSnapshot` + `FlatDiscountCurve` behind a `CurveHandle` (df = exp(-r t)).
  - L2 `FixedCashflowTrade` (frozen, no `pv` method).
  - L4 `DiscountingEngine.price(...)` (null model; failure-as-value).
  - L5 `dv01` by bumping the snapshot; L6 `book(trade).value(...)`.
  - Oracle: PV = notional·exp(-r·t) closed form < 1e-12; analytic vs
    central-difference DV01 < 1e-6; repricing byte-identical (statelessness).
  - Quarry: `core/currency.py`, `core/day_count.py`, `core/numerical_config.py`,
    `core/discount_curve.py`, `fixed_income/fixed_leg.py` (Cashflow).

## [0.0.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- Bootstrap of the new tree: layer packages (`foundation`, `market`,
  `instruments`, `models`, `engine`, `risk`, `shell`), `verify.py`
  (`acyclic`/`tests`/`debt`/`provenance`/`version`/`all`), CI matrix
  (Ubuntu + Windows, Python 3.12), `.gitattributes` (LF), root `conftest.py`.
